The festival is breathtaking, and we could have the opportunity if took a lot of pictures.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/vivid-3.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/vivid-4.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/vivid-5.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/vivid-6.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/vivid-7.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/vivid-8.jpg\"/></p>\n<h2 id=\"walking\">Walking</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (steps)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Sydney (today)</td>\n<td>19.213</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>1.375.461</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>1.394.674</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n","updatedAt":"2017-09-05T17:40:56.000Z"}
