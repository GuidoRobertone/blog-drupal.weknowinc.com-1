But don’t get confuse with that title; because the metro area has 30+ million residents, that mean is bigger that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City\">Mexico City</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai\">Mumbai</a>.</p>\n<p>Chongqing is located close to the Tibet and by close I mean 1500 kilometres, but is the closer than my usual location, I will miss this time,  I have to left something unseen to have an excuse to return.</p>\n<p>My flight was good just almost 3 hours and  <a href=\"http://ranqiangjun.com\">Qiangjun Ran</a> with other members of the local Drupal community were waiting for me to lead me to my hotel. Later on, they invited me to eat a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_pot\">Hot Pot</a> and I survive, of course, they told me they choose a beginner level for me.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/chongqing-welcome-1.jpg\"/>\n<br/><br/>\n<img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/chongqing-welcome-2.jpg\"/>\n<br/><br/>\n<img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/chongqing-hot-pot.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>After dinner, we have a walk around the are just to get familiar and reduce the changes I get lost the next days, I really appreciate that, Chongqing guys are excellent hosts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"airplane\">Airplane</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (Kilometers)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Beijing, China &#8594; Chongqing, China</td>\n<td>1.458</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>28.845</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>30.293</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"bus-car\">Bus/Car</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (Kilometers)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Today</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>628</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>628</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"walking\">Walking</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (steps)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Beijing/Chongqing (today)</td>\n<td>16.363</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>739.562</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>755.925</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n","updatedAt":"2017-09-05T17:40:56.000Z"}
