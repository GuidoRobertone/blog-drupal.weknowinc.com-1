By the way, Bali is much bigger than you could imagine.</p>\n<p>First, I visited a theater where is represented and traditional play named <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barong_(mythology\">Barong &amp; Keris</a>) a mythological representation of the battle of good and evil forces.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/barong-keris-1.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/barong-keris-2.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>The second stop was in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batuan,_Bali\">Puseh Temple</a>, Bali if full of temples, so is easy to find one, most of them are Hindu because contrary of the rest of Indonesia Bali is mostly Hinduist.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/puseh-temple-1.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/puseh-temple-2.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>About mid day, the driver leads me on into a Coffee to try the most expensive coffee in the world. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kopi_Luwak\">Luwak coffee</a> I stop drink coffee about 14 years ago, but I tried,  to be honest, I didn’t note anything wrong or good in that coffee.</p>\n<p>Also, the coffee shop offers a “free” degustation of a variety of teas and coffees. Each drink had remarkable properties to protect you again any major diseases, so because I try all of them, I am protected at least for about five years.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/luwak-coffee-1.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/luwak-coffee-2.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>My last stop was in the great <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanah_Lot\">Tanah Lot</a>, there is not too much to say about this place, just see the pictures.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/tanah-lot-1.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/tanah-lot-2.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/tanah-lot-3.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/tanah-lot-4.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>Bali is nice, but traveling alone here is not funny, I miss my Yersika, especially in this breathtaking places that I know she will love to take pictures.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bus-car\">Bus/Car</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (Kilometers)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Today</td>\n<td>84</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>1.046</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>1.130</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"walking\">Walking</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (steps)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Bali (today)</td>\n<td>5.305</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>1.241.295</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>1.246.600</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n","updatedAt":"2017-09-05T17:40:56.000Z"}
