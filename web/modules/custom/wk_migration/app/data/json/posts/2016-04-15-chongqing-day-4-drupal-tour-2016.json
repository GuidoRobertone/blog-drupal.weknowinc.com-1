Fortunately,  my friend <strong>Jungle</strong> rectify the instructions and after take a bus I was there.</p>\n<p>Beeing honest, I was a little upset due how long the park is, and the fact it was drizzling and I didn’t have an umbrella; But, I was there, and I have to see the place. The park has a “bus” services using golf cars show can see all park in few minutes, so I decided to take the bus.</p>\n<p>As soon the golf car leaves the station and drove into the park my mood entirely change; Because the park is full of trails, lakes, cascades, shrines, temples and a lot of beautiful gardens. Even though was drizzling the view was gorgeous, so I get off the golf car and start walking on my own.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/expo-park-1.jpg\"/>\n<br/><br/>\n<img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/expo-park-2.jpg\"/>\n<br/><br/>\n<img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/expo-park-3.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>I don’t think, so my mobile camera was enough to capture the beauty of this place, so far, my favorite place in Chongqing city.</p>\n<h2 id=\"walking\">Walking</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (steps)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Chongqing (today)</td>\n<td>15,701</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>804.350</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>820.051</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n","updatedAt":"2017-09-05T17:40:56.000Z"}
