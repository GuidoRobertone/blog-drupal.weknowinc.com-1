I use the Limousine Bus, which an express bus from Osaka station to KIX airport, was a 55 minutes trip. Caveats, they only allow buy ticket for the same day and only cash.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, I get early in the airport because the immigration queue was huge, like 300 meters, and they create a maze to try to organize people, wasn’t his first day doing that, because, the maze works.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/osaka_queue.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>In Shanghai, I made a huge mistake; I put on my phone an older sim card I have in my luggage from Vietnam, so I never could get connected. So was tough to get connected with <a href=\"http://www.bootdev.com/#about\">Keith Yau</a>. </p>\n<p>Inside the station, I found a police station and they lend me the phone to call Keith girlfriend Becky, and they rescue me, after that we join with Jackie Chang in a restaurant, and I tried my first Hot Pot.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/hot-pot-1.jpg\"/>\n<br/><br/>\n<img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/hot-pot-2.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>Until now, Shanghai looks like a big city of USA very modern and with good infrastructure. If you are wondering about air quality, everything looks ok, and I don’t see anybody using masks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"airplane\">Airplane</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (Kilometers)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Osaka, Japan &#8594; Shanghai, China</td>\n<td>1.552</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>26.224</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>27.776</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"bus-car\">Bus/Car</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (Kilometers)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Tokyo, Japan &#8594; Osaka, Japan</td>\n<td>503</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>503</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"walking\">Walking</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (steps)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Osaka (today)</td>\n<td>5.242</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>498.679</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>503.921</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n","updatedAt":"2017-09-05T17:40:56.000Z"}
