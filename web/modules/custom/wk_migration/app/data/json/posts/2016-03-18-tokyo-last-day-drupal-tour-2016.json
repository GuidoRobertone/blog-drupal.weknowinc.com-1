So, I decided to stay in my hotel until checkout time 11 a.m to do some office work to rest. I know is weird to say I will work for rest but it’s true.</p>\n<p>My hotel was “close” is Chiyoda area in Tokyo, so, I decided to walk to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Imperial_Palace#East_Garden\"> Imperial Palace East Garden</a> a vast green are in the center of Tokyo.</p>\n<p>The park wasn’t special at the end of winter, but I can image in two weeks in Sprint will be gorgeous</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/imperial-garden.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>I continue my walk towards the Imperial Palace, again with a magnificent garden, but at the end I realize this is not an attraction the Emperor lives there, so you can’t get in, some people were mad about that I didn’t know why.</p>\n<p>I ended my up day visiting again Akibara you bought some animes for friends in Latin America and a memory card replacement for my camera.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/anime-alexander.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>With not enough time to do something else in tourist aspect, I return to the hotel to spend some hours in the lobby watching a movie and planning my visit to Indonesia, looks like I will visit Jakarta and Bali.</p>\n<p>At night, I took a bus to Osaka, was a special bus with three seats per row all independent and you can almost lay down, also do you have curtains to have some privacy. The trips take 8 hours, and I slept all the trip, I don’t know the rest of passengers because I am sure I snore, sorry about that folks. </p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/osaka-bus.jpg\"/></p>\n<h2 id=\"airplane\">Airplane</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (Kilometers)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Seoul, South Korea &#8594; Tokyo, Japan</td>\n<td>1.154</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>25.070</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>26.224</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"bus-car\">Bus/Car</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (Kilometers)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Tokyo, Japan &#8594; Osaka, Japan</td>\n<td>503</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>503</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"walking\">Walking</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (steps)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Tokyo (today)</td>\n<td>16.129</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>410.985</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>427.114</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n","updatedAt":"2017-09-05T17:40:56.000Z"}
