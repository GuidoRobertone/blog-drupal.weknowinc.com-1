All via a mentor and self-training. his is a living proof of with determination you can do an 180 degrees change in your life, all you need is passion and termination.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, this camp was a good first DrupalCamp for their community, of course, there a lot of space to increase the Drupal penetration in Vietnam, but the realization of this kind of events is a huge jump towards that objective.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (steps)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Hanoi (today)</td>\n<td>9.056</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>240.807</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>249.863</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n","updatedAt":"2017-09-05T17:40:56.000Z"}
