The game is an intermediate point between <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football\">soccer</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_football\">rubgy</a>, but the usage of the word football is accurate because they use a lot their feets.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/footy-2.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/footy-3.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>Some interesting thing I notice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nine umpires</li>\n<li>They have like coach assistances they can get on the field during the game to provide instructions.</li>\n<li>The Waterboys are allowed to get on the field during the match.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In summary was a good game St Kilda defeat Freemantle 101 - 67, but was a vibrant play, I could say I enjoy it. In total, we were 17.927 attendees, but the stadium looks empty so the total capacity must be about 75.000.</p>\n<p>To finish our day, we ate seafood noodles.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/melbourne-noodles-seafood.jpg\"/></p>\n<h2 id=\"walking\">Walking</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (steps)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Tasmania (today)</td>\n<td>6.187</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>1.336.344</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>1.342.531</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n","updatedAt":"2017-09-05T17:40:56.000Z"}
