But this the biggest time difference I have traveled before in my life, so I expect in a week, or so my circadian rhythm gets use to the change.</p>\n<p>As a result, today I get up a little late, so I decided to visit temples, the first one was the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhivinayak_Temple,_Mumbai\">Siddhivinayak Temple</a>, the template was so crowded with queue about 200 meters, but at least, the line moves faster, so the wait was about 10 minutes. After passing the “security control”, I have to remove my shoes, and everybody was offering flowers to their god, and I saw there is something related to coconut waterm that I can’t understand. Sadly pictures weren’t allowed.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/shree_temple.png\"/></p>\n<p>In general, a quick visit, and excellent if you want to try to live the experience of an Indian temple.</p>\n<p>After finish this temple I walk around two hours with a real destination, I just want to explore to see how looks the real Mumbai and to find a place to take a lunch. I have to say Mumbai is indeed a city of contrast. On one hand you can see a lot of small informal business and people almost living in streets and on the other side of the same street, a vast complex of building for offices of people working for multinationals companies or hotel lie Four Season in the middle of that neighborhoods.</p>\n<p>Almost in front of Four Seasons hotel, there is a tiny restaurant where I order Fish and a tomato soup. Because, in my mind I have the idea how a Tomato soup could be spicy, and I didn’t say “no spice please”, and guest what the did it the spiciest tomato soup I tried in my life and I could handle. </p>\n<p>Anyhow, I continue my route to visit the <a href=\"http://www.hajialidargah.in\">Haji Ali Dargah</a>, and I have to say that doesn’t look like pictures, the place is running down. </p>\n<p>Returning home, I got notified by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/anigupta\">Ani</a> that there is a pre-party meet up at <a href=\"https://www.zomato.com/mumbai/rude-lounge-hill-road-bandra-west\">Rude Lounge</a> were we met with <a href=\"(http://dasjo.at\">Dasjo</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_klausi_\">klausinho</a>, <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/rachit_gupta\">Rachit gupta</a> and others Drupal that I don’t have contact, shame on me. Good food, good place and nice talk the perfect combination to close a day.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/rude_lounge.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>In few hours my wife <a href=\"http://yersika.com\">Yersila</a> is about the take a flight to the USA and after few days we will reunite in Singapore, have a good fly honey.</p>\n<h2 id=\"walking\">Walking</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (steps)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Mumbai (Today)</td>\n<td>5245</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>60.134</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>65.379</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n","updatedAt":"2017-09-05T17:40:56.000Z"}
