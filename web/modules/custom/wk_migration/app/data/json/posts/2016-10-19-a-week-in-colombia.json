{"layout":"post","title":"A week in Colombia","categories":["Articles"],"tags":["Community","Contribute","Drupal","Travel","enzotour16","Colombia","Bogota","Bucaramanga"],"body":"<p>Last week  I had the opportunity to back to Colombia as para of my tour <a href=\"http://enzolutions.com/articles/2016/01/19/around-the-drupal-world-in-120-day\">Around the Drupal world in 140+ days</a>.</p>\n<p>To be honest, this stop wasn’t planned, during my visit to France the border control officer inform to me about a situation with my passport, I was almost done with the space for new stamps. That situation forces me to try to get a new passport as soon as possible; After checking to Colombian embassy in Costa Rica, I confirm that renew my passport in Costa Rica wasn’t an option due the return time. For that reason, I have to travel to Colombia to renew my passport there.</p>\n<p>With this un expected trip I tried to use in as many activities I could. In Drupal Side, I participated in a Drupal Meetup organized by <a href=\"http://seed.com.co\">Seed</a>, and particularly by <a href=\"http://www.aldibier.com/\">Aldibier Morales</a>. They rent and space and organize the event to enable me to talk about Drupal Console and Drupal Community in general, I enjoy the <strong>Q &amp; A</strong> session, where I could provide some points of view I have about how to handle local communities.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/IMG_20161014_030733.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>With my new passport on my hands, I start a marathon to visit my mother and father familly located in Bucaramanga, Santader. Was really good because for many years I haven’t visit them.</p>\n<p>So, as many time in my #enzotour16 I overcome the adversities and transform in something positive as much I could it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"airplane\">Airplane</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (Kilometers)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>San Jose, Costa Rica &#8594; Bogota, Colombia  &#8594; San Jose, Costa Rica</td>\n<td>2.576</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>106.561</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>109.137</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"walking\">Walking</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (steps)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Colombia</td>\n<td>39.597</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>1.897.088</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>1.936.685</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"train\">Train</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (Kilometers)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Today</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>528</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>528</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h1 id=\"bus-car\">Bus/Car</h1>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (Kilometers)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Today</td>\n<td>796</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>2.944</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>3.740</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n","updatedAt":"2017-09-05T17:40:56.000Z"}
