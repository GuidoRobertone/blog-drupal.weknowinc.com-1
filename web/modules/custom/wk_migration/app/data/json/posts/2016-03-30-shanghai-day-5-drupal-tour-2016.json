In the floor bellow was located at 263 meters the view was quite better here, but the visibility of the city wasn’t  good due the level of pollution which was 160 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_quality_index\">AQI</a> according to <a href=\"http://aqicn.org/city/shanghai\">World Air Quality Index team</a> which is unhealthy.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/shanghai-pollution.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>The best part of the tower is a transparent observatory, where you can walk on a glass floor and deal with your levels of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrophobia\">Acrophobia</a>.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/glass-floor-1.jpg\"/>\n<br/><br/>\n<img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/glass-floor-2.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>At the bottom of the tower, you could visit a Shanghai History Museum.</p>\n<p>At night, I went to <a href=\"https://it-consultis.com/\">IT Consultis</a> office to meet with some developers and his Chief Operating Officer. Their office is located close to French concession neighborhood so went to in bar to have some drink about how is working in China society.</p>\n<h2 id=\"walking\">Walking</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (steps)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Shanghai (today)</td>\n<td>13.834</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>576.469</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>590.303</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n","updatedAt":"2017-09-05T17:40:56.000Z"}
