I ordered <strong>Iced Noodles</strong> using a vendor machine.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/vendor-machine.jpg\"/>\n<br/><br/>\n<img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/vendor-machine-menu.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>I was thinking they were talking about the noodle style, but was literally in <strong>ICE</strong>.  </p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/ice-noodles.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>I’m sure that kind of noodles is typical here, but for me it was crazy.</p>\n<p>Continuing with the cultural tour, we visit the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyeongbokgung\">Gyeongbok Palace</a>, this palace is like the Korean version of Forbidden City in China. The price is low and fortunately, we were in time to take the Free guided tour in English. There other free tours in Chinese and Japanese, three time per day.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/korean-palace.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>Next to the palace, we found the <a href=\"http://www.nfm.go.kr\">National Folks Museum</a> and we could appreciate part of the Korean culture.</p>\n<p>One thing I don’t get is young people were wearing typical customs and taking pictures of themselves, and others were like being models for foreign photographers.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/enzo-korean-girl.jpg\"/></p>\n<h2 id=\"walking\">Walking</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (steps)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Seoul (today)</td>\n<td>11.247</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>268.891</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>280.138</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n","updatedAt":"2017-09-05T17:40:56.000Z"}
