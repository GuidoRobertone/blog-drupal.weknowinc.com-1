Implementations of this have a lot of value in a vast spectrum of business; I will try it in deep and investigate to use with Drupal 8 soon and maybe create a session to talk about this soon.</p>\n<p>In the afternoon, guided by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HappyJiyoung\">Jiyoung Yun</a> we visit the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangnam_District\">Gangnam District</a>.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/gangnam-style.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>She explains us a little bit about South Korean culture. Meanwhile, we walk and drink some typical Korean tea. </p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/korean-tea.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>Our tour in Gangnam ended up at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seonjeongneung\">Seonjeongneung</a> which is the burial grounds of two Joseon Dynasty Kings and one Joseon Queen.</p>\n<h2 id=\"walking\">Walking</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (steps)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Seoul (today)</td>\n<td>13.745</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>315.512</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>329.257</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n","updatedAt":"2017-09-05T17:40:56.000Z"}
