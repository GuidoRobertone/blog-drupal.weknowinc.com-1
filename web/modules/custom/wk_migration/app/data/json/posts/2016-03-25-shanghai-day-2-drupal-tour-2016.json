The most important thing I did was to go to the Indonesian Embassy in Shanghai to request my visa, to visit the Drupal Communities Jakarta and Bali.</p>\n<p>At the beginning they donâ€™t to accept my request, due, I am not a China resident or with a work permit, but I mentioned them,  that on their website they said is possible, and I bring bank account statements. Everything was easier when I mentioned I got my visa to Australia, and that I have to Indonesian friends where I will stay. So, they request me to email the visa, and my friends have to email them an invitation letter.</p>\n<p>So, I have to return to where I am staying to try to contact my friend, due; I did have Internet connection at that time. Fortunately, I could contact <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/suryanto\">Suryanto Rachmat</a>, and he gave the invitation letter. Now, I have to wait a week to get my passport, and I hope my last visa in this trip. </p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/embassy_indonesia.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>After the Indonesian visa, I will have 3.5 empty pages in my passport, in theory, is enough to back home, we will see.</p>\n<p>In the rest of my day, I just learn a little more about China society with <strong>Bootdev</strong> team and take a long nap in the afternoon; I will return to sightseeing activities tomorrow.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/shanghai-noddles.jpg\"/></p>\n<h2 id=\"walking\">Walking</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (steps)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Shanghai (today)</td>\n<td>11.808</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>520.739</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>532.547</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n","updatedAt":"2017-09-05T17:40:56.000Z"}
