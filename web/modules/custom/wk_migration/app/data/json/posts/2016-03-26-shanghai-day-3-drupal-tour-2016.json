In the other side, I realize the service was to cross the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huangpu_River\">Huangpu River</a> to the financial district, so I just walk around that and take a nice walk to the shore of the river.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/perl-tower.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>As you maybe know I am a soup person and in Asia I am a noodle person, so I got a noodle and continued my way to meet with <strong>Clark</strong> who helps me to practice some Chinese words, and we share a coffee that I was able to order by myself thanks his guidance.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/clark-teacher.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>At the end of the day, I meet with <a href=\"https://www.adammalone.net/about\">Adam Malone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/feliperubim\">Felipe Rubim</a> and DrupalCamp China organizers to take some drinks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"walking\">Walking</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (steps)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Shanghai (today)</td>\n<td>16.391</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>532.547</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>548.938</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n","updatedAt":"2017-09-05T17:40:56.000Z"}
