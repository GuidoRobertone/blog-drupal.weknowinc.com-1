The MD extension stands for MarkDown which is a series of dialing rules that will generate a HTML without knowing HTML for tags like bold, subtitle and other special labels in a similar way to that done by <a href=\"http://wikipedia.org\">http://wikipedia.org</a>.</p>\n<p>If you want to know a little more about MarkDown you can check the version of Github at <a href=\"https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown\">https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown</a> and BitBucket version at  <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/tutorials/markdowndemo\">https://bitbucket.org/tutorials/markdowndemo</a>.</p>\n<p>When we have mastered the MarkDown creating sections within our document, the natural evolution is to make a table of contents to make it easier to navigate through Readme file doing our project more professional, but this task can be cumbersome luckily we will see below a tool that does this job for us.</p>\n<p>#Install DocToc</p>\n<p>Assuming you have Node.js installed in your system and therefore the npm command is available run the following command to install the DocToc project.</p>\n<pre><code>$ npm install -g doctoc\n</code></pre><p>#Generating TOC</p>\n<p>Once installed we just need to indicate on which files we are going to generate the TOC. If our project is in github only must execute the following command</p>\n<pre><code>$ doctoc README.md\n</code></pre><p>If our project is hosted in Bitbucket we just need execute the command with a slight variation as shown below.</p>\n<pre><code>$ doctoc README.md --bitbucket\n</code></pre><p>You can see a TOC generated by this command in the project <a href=\"https://github.com/enzolutions/community-bookstore/\">https://github.com/enzolutions/community-bookstore/</a></p>\n<p>I hope you have been to his liking.</p>\n","updatedAt":"2017-09-05T17:40:56.000Z"}
