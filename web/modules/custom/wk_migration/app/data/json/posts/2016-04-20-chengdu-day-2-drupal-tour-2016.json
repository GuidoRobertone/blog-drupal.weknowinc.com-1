So I get up early and try to visit couple places in the morning just to have a glance of Chengdu.</p>\n<p>Firstly, I decided to visit the <strong>Manjusri Monastery</strong> or Wenshu Monastery/文殊院, which is a buddies temple, with a lot of monks inside and looks like there are residences for them behind the temples.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/manjusri-monastery-1.jpg\"/>\n<br/><br/> \n<img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/manjusri-monastery-2.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>I was a little worry about the traffic, so I have other places in my list, but I  prefer to walk around to check, and I see, and I found the <strong>Aidao Nunnery</strong> or Ancient Yuanjue Nunnery. This temple was reconstructed this century and have a good shape and nice decorations.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/aidao-nunnery-1.jpg\"/>\n<br/><br/> \n<img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/aidao-nunnery-2.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>At the afternoon, I said goodbye to China and departure to Bangkok, Thailand. I know you could say, but you will go to Hong Kong and Taiwan, well those are other Chinas like Singapore.</p>\n<h2 id=\"airplane\">Airplane</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (Kilometers)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Chengdu, China &#8594; Bangkok, Thailand</td>\n<td>1.918</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>30.293</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>32.211</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"train\">Train</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (Kilometers)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Today</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>366</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>366</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"bus-car\">Bus/Car</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (Kilometers)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Today</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>628</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>628</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"walking\">Walking</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (steps)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Chongqing/Chengdu (today)</td>\n<td>12.121</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>853.448</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>865.569</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n","updatedAt":"2017-09-05T17:40:56.000Z"}
