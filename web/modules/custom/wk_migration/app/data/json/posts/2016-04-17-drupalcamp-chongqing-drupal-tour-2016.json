{"layout":"post","title":"DrupalCamp Chongqing - Drupal Tour 2016","categories":["Articles"],"tags":["Travel","Enzotour16","Drupal","Chongqing","China"],"body":"<p>Yesterday was a big day for Drupal Community in Chongqing, China, due they celebrate their first <a href=\"2016.drupalchongqing.org\">DrupalCamp</a>.</p>\n<p>The Drupal community in China in general in just growing and growing and Chongqing community organize this DrupalCamp in 50 days. Their speakers came from Beijing, Shanghai and other major Chinese cities.</p>\n<p>One impressive fact is the support of <a href=\"http://english.cqmu.edu.cn/\">Chongqing medical university</a> and more specifically their <strong>Clinical Medicine</strong> program, this program is using Drupal to improve the information system and doing research to connect with Open Hardware, which is quite interesting.</p>\n<p>Regarding numbers, the event had about 120+ attendees; this is not an official statistic, is just my appreciation.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/drupalcamp_chongqing.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>I had the honor of being the Keynote in this event, in my session I talk about why “<strong>Investing in the community is a good business</strong>“, you can review the slides <a href=\"http://bit.ly/enzotour16-chongqing\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/drupalcamp-chongqing-keynote.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>Also, I have the opportunity of talk about <a href=\"http://drupalconsole.com\">Drupal Console</a> project; I lead this session with <a href=\"http://ranqiangjun.com\">Jungle</a> who by the way is the responsible for the Chinese translation of Drupal Console and the leader and co - organizer of this Drupalcamp.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/drupalcamp-chongqing-console.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>Based on some comments I could say this Drupal Camp set a precedent in Drupal Chinese community. Next events over China will try to imitate their level of organization and try to be more official which means in Chinese culture perhaps more political, but maybe that is what is necessary to increase the participation of China in Drupal international community.</p>\n<p>Well done Chongqing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"walking\">Walking</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (steps)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Chongqing (today)</td>\n<td>15,209</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>825.352</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>840.561</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n","updatedAt":"2017-09-05T17:40:56.000Z"}
