Instead of I visit today other temples.</p>\n<p>My first temple was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hsing_Tian_Kong\">Xingtian Temple</a>; I was surprised because again the temple was crowded and in the middle of a religious service, I expect some time just to feel the environment.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/xingtian-temple-1.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/xingtian-temple-2.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>Later on, I visited the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taipei_Confucius_Temple\">Taipei Confucius Temple</a>, a beautiful complex that includes some artist performance some Asian instruments. </p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/taipei-confucius-temple-1.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/taipei-confucius-temple-2.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>Almost in next door,  is located the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalongdong_Baoan_Temple\">Baoan Temple</a> which is the biggest temple in Taipei and declared as UNESCO Asia-Pacific Heritage in 2003.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/baoan-temple-1.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/baoan-temple-2.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>At that moment, I was tired of seeing temples, and I want to do something more mundane; So against my rules, I decided to try to find a movie theater to watch <strong>Civil War</strong> the latest Marvel movie. </p>\n<p>Using my phone, I found a movie theater near to a metro station, wasn’t hard to find, but I was expecting a mall with a cinema complex inside, but instead I found and small and independent movie theater, happily I could check the film was available in English with Chinese traditional subtitles. Being sincere I have to confess that I always use English subtitles to watch a movie if it’s not available in Spanish, but I could say I understand about 80% of the film.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/movie-civil-war.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>Looking for something to eat I visited the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shilin_Night_Market\">Shilin Night Market</a> a colorful place, especially regarding food variety; as a good tourist, I bought some stuff and ate in the traditional food court in the market.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/shilin-night-market-1.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/shilin-night-market-2.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/shilin-night-market-3.jpg\"/></p>\n<h2 id=\"walking\">Walking</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (steps)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Taipei (today)</td>\n<td>18,952</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>1.011.504</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>1.030.456</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n","updatedAt":"2017-09-05T17:40:56.000Z"}
