{"layout":"post","title":"Hong Kong Day 1 - Drupal Tour 2016","categories":["Articles"],"tags":["Travel","Enzotour16","Hong Kong"],"body":"<p>As I said before, for my Hong Kong is not China, for many reasons. First, one Hong Kong citizens don’t have the same rights as other Chinese folks in the mainland ( Mainland identify areas outside Hong Kong and Macau). B. They have a different system of visas than Mainland and C. They are more English oriented than the rest of China.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, I decided to don’t visit a particular place, instead of I just visit some public spaces to feel the city, my first stop was in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kowloon_Park\">Kowloon Park</a> a big green area in Hong Kong, which is weird, due the high prices of land. This place as I expected was full of Senior citizens practicing Thai Chi; the park is also used for cultural representation, and there is an Aviary in the middle of the park.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/kowloon-park-seniors.jpg\"/>\n<br/><br/>\n<img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/kowloon-park-aviary.jpg\"/>\n<br/><br/>\n<img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/kowloon-park-anime-statue.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>Later on, I went out to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kowloon_Park\">West Kowloon Waterfront Promenade</a>, The area is under construction, but the Promenade is still there, with a good view of Hong Kong, but Hong Kong was cloudy, so the pictures are not totally clear.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/west-kowloon.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>After that, I walked in direction to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsim_Sha_Tsui\">Tsim Sha Tsui</a> to see the promenade located there and take a ferry from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Harbour\">Victoria Harbur</a></p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/hongkong-ferry.jpg\"/>\n<br/><br/>\n<img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/hong-kong-island.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>In the other side is located the Hong Kong island, so I just roam between a network of bridges that connect upscale shopping malls, before to took a train to visit Dried Seafood Street located at [Des Voeux Road](<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Des_Voeux_Road\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Des_Voeux_Road</a>]. I was expecting something like a Chinatown but was clean and organized, but the food of course very exotic.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/dry-seafood-1.jpg\"/>\n<br/><br/>\n<img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/dry-seafood-2.jpg\"/>\n<br/><br/>\n<img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/dry-seafood-3.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>At night, I met with my friend <strong>Jackie Chang</strong> from <a href=\"http://bootdev.com\">BootDev</a> to have a dinner and later on see other folks for a Drupal Happy Hour meetup.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/hong-kong-dinner-jackie.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>As always, was a great night with my friend Jackie.</p>\n<h2 id=\"walking\">Walking</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (steps)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Bangkok (today)</td>\n<td>22.426</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>932.080</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>954.506</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n","updatedAt":"2017-09-05T17:40:56.000Z"}
