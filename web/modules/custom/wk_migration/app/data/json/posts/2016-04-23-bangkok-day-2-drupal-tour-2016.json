For that reason Yesterday, I expend all my morning dealing with Medical insurances, booking of hotels and coordinate with local organizers details about the sessions.</p>\n<p>In the afternoon, I had lunch with <a href=\"http://www.fluxus.io/\">Fluxus</a> team.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/fluxux-lunch.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>Later on, I went out to the world famous <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat_Pho\">Wat Pho</a> Buddhist temple, O.K maybe you don’t know the place for that name, but perhaps you are familiar with the giant Reclining Buddha.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/giant-buddha-1.jpg\"/>\n<br/><br/>\n<img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/giant-buddha-2.jpg\"/>\n<br/><br/>\n<img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/wat-pho-1.jpg\"/>\n<br/><br/>\n<img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/wat-pho-2.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>But that Buddha is not the only interesting Buddha to see; the place is a compound of temples, Buddha, and halls full of Buddhas in all material, color, and sizes you can imagine, thousands and thousands of Buddhas, I totally recommend this spot in Bangkok.</p>\n<p>My next stop lead me to another Buddhist temple <a href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat_Rakhang\">Wat Rakhang</a>, to be honest, I was planning a different temple, but the taxi driver recommends me this because was better that the first one I choose. Regarding sightseeing aspect, the temple was just fine; But maybe the interesting fact is that that place is a Buddhist University with a lot of people studying the Buddha philosophy.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/wat-rakhang-1.jpg\"/>\n<br/><br/>\n<img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/wat-rakhang-2.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>Also, the place has a pier in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chao_Phraya_River\">Chao_Phraya</a> river, with a lot of tours for tourist like me, but I didn’t take the option.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/wat-rakhang-pier-2.jpg\"/></p>\n<h2 id=\"walking\">Walking</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (steps)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Bangkok (today)</td>\n<td>12.295</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>889.174</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>901.469</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n","updatedAt":"2017-09-05T17:40:56.000Z"}
