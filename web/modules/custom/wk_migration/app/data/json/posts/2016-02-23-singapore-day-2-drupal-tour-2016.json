{"layout":"post","title":"Singapore Day 2 - Drupal Tour 2016","categories":["Articles"],"tags":["Travel","Enzotour16","Singapore"],"body":"<p>Yesterday with all our batteries we traced our plan to try to visit and do as much as possible.</p>\n<p>Our first stop was in Singapore Chinatown to eat a delicious Dim Sum for a reasonable price.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/dim-sum.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>After our breakfast, we continue to the Embassy of Indonesia. Why, well at the past DrupalCon in India and couple conversations with some members of the community, I realise that will be more valuable regarding the objectives of my <a href=\"({{site.url }}/articles/2016/01/19/around-the-drupal-world-in-120-days\">trip</a> exchange New Zealand by Indonesia. For that reason I went to that embassy to try to get my visa.</p>\n<p>Before to continue I want to say I love the web application <a href=\"http://gothere.sg\">http://gothere.sg</a>; The public transport works in Singapore. I never have to wait more than 3 minutes for my next ride and the application provide exact information about how and what is the fast way to reach my destination.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/gothere.png\"/></p>\n<p>In the embassy, I notice the rules said MENs can’t enter to the embassy in shorts and guess what I was wearing. I was ready to appeal to the security lady, but, as soon she sees my hairy legs, she provide to me a pair of sweat pants to enable me to get inside the embassy. </p>\n<p>With the help desk for visas, I could determine that I have a present a real flight ticket to Indonesia, and I am not available to buy due I have to define my visit to the Philippines to try to participate in their Drupal Camp, so I will postpone my visa request to Vietnam at least.</p>\n<p>To continue with our tourist mission, we take a bus towards “Gardens by the Bay”, these attraction consist of a dome dedicated to flowers around the world and a dome decided to cloud forest. The architecture of the place in conjunction that everything is just beautiful makes me felt that paid $28 SGD per person is a bargain.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/gardes-dome-1.jpg\"/>\n<br/><br/>\n<img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/gardes-dome-2.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>Inside gardens, the is a  bridge with 22 meters height and 100 long that allow you the whole area with a magnificent view, the access cost 5 SGD.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/gardes-bridge.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>We decided to find a place to direct in direct to The Merlion, and sadly we find a place in Singapore river area. A place with a nice view and good vibe, we drunk a jug of beer, and then the menu, a combination of English and Chinese. I felt in the typical scam for tourists bad food, overpriced; I have to say we pay a fortune and good looking food but tiny tiny and with a bad taste :S</p>\n<p>With our sullied pride, we continue The Merlion, and we got good pictures, ending the day we felt still a little hunger and them we find a ramen place in Four Square, right price and excellent taste, so lesson learned, double check the final price and about confusing menus.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/ramen-marisco.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>Back home I started to think about a technical post for my company related with Drupal 8, and I wrote the blog post <a href=\"http://www.anexusit.com/blog/debugging-twig-templates-drupal-8-kint\">Debugging Twig templates in Drupal 8 Kint</a>.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow I will meet with a local drupaler in the morning and at night I will participate in a <a href=\"https://groups.drupal.org/node/504398\">Drupal Meetup Singapore</a> and of course, try to visit a tourist place. </p>\n<h2 id=\"walking\">Walking</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (steps)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Singapore (Today)</td>\n<td>22.249</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>124.667</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>146.916</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n","updatedAt":"2017-09-05T17:40:56.000Z"}
