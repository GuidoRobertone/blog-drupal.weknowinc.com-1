Stable for <a href=\"http://drupalconsole.com\">Drupal Console</a> project our most important issue “Composer compatibility.”</p>\n<p>Back to the sightseeing, we went first to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Arizona_Memorial\">Pearl Harbour Historic Sites</a>. Was impossible to visit the memorial for people who died during Japanese attack due the wind and due the ticket ran out early in the morning all days.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the area has other military museums, and I visited fist the [\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Bowfin_(SS-287\">USS Bowfin Submarine</a>), my first submarine and even that the vessel was old was quite interesting.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/uss-bowfin-sub-1.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/uss-bowfin-sub-2.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>The second museum was the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Missouri_(BB-63\">USS Missouri</a>) this battleship is important because on this ship the Japanese Empire sign their surrender and end the World War II.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/battleship-missouri-memorial-1.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/battleship-missouri-memorial-2.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>But, we were in Hawaii; So, we just choose a random place on the map, and I drove to explore the island, we visited the <a href=\"http://www.gohawaii.com/treks/oahu/haleiwa-beach-park.html\">Haleiwa Beach Park</a>. As you can imagine an awesome place, I love the fact in all this park on the beach you could find public showers, bathrooms, and free parking.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/haleiwa-beach-1.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/haleiwa-beach-2.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>To finish our day, we decided to find a place to see the sunset and on the map, we see there a beach named “Sunset Beach” so the decision wasn’t  hard.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/sunset-at-sunset-beach.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/sunset-beach-1.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/sunset-beach-2.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>At the end of the day, I complete a spin around the island.</p>\n<h1 id=\"bus-car\">Bus/Car</h1>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (Kilometers)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Today</td>\n<td>103</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>2.142</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>2.245</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"walking\">Walking</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (steps)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Sydney (today)</td>\n<td>6.339</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>1.464.633</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>1.470.972</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n","updatedAt":"2017-09-05T17:40:56.000Z"}
