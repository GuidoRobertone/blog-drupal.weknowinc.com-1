{"layout":"post","title":"What is Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)","description":"Explanation about Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).","categories":["articles"],"tags":["Ajax","CORS","WWW"],"draft":false,"body":"<p>Nowdays is pretty common to transfer data between web applications via Web Services to  clients that require information on different interfaces such as REST, XMLRPC, JSON, JSON-RPC, SOAP and others.</p>\n<p>Almost all sites today are built using JavaScript, generating AJAX calls with XMLHttpRequest mechanism to get information  from external sites. To enable this kind of comunication is necessary implement “cross-domain” requests would otherwise be forbidden by web browsers, per the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy\">same origin security policy</a>.</p>\n<p>Lets imagine the following scenery: we have a frontend application using the domain <a href=\"http://a.com\">http://a.com</a> and this application wants to use data provided by a  backend site located in domain <a href=\"http://b.com\">http://b.com</a>. For security this type of communication is blocked and the end user will be only able to get the information from <a href=\"http://a.com\">http://a.com</a>, this scenario is exemplified in the following image.</p>\n<p><img src=\"{{ site.url }}/assets/img/crossdomain.png\"/></p>\n<p>To enable this kind of communication is requiered that your backed server (http//b.com) returns the specific HTTP Headers to enable CORS comunication. Below you can see an example of HTTP Header required.</p>\n<pre><code>Access-Control-Allow-Credentials:true\nAccess-Control-Allow-Headers:X-CSRF-Token\nAccess-Control-Allow-Methods:POST,ADD,GET,PUT,DELETE,OPTIONS\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin:http://localhost:8080\n</code></pre><p>The header <em>Access-Control-Allow-Credentials</em> is only used if your request require some kind of authentication. You can read more information about all HTTP Headers at <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS\">Access Controls - CORS</a>.</p>\n","updatedAt":"2017-09-05T17:40:56.000Z"}
