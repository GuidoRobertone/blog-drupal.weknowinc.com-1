Inside there are two levels of shops with original designs about everything, like bags, bikes, cloth, suitcases, etc.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/desing-shops.jpg\"/>\n<br/><br/>\n<img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/desing-shops-2.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>The more interesting shop I saw was a business that prints a person or persons in a 3D model, but the result is almost inside perfect in detail.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/3d-model-machine.jpg\"/>\n<br/><br/>\n<img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/3d-model-cameras.jpg\"/>\n<br/><br/>\n<img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/3d-models.jpg\"/>\n<br/><br/>\n<img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/ddp-stairs.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>I am not a shopping person, but I was tempted to buy some stuff more than one time, I have to content myself saying, OK you don’t’ need that or ok buddy you still have to visit like 12 more airports, you don’t have to carry that.</p>\n<p>In my return, by accident, I get inside <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so_B6mwGsYQ\">Euljiro Underground Pedestrian Arcade</a> under the downtown area line 2. It’s located from Dongdaemun Historic &amp; Culture Park to City Hall with an extension of 3.3 km, and I walked about 2.5 km.</p>\n<p>The pedestrian arcade is so convenience to walk in winter and summer, inside you could find almost everything, from food, clothes, printing companies or digital lockers, so was a lucky accident.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/maps-shops.jpg\"/>\n<br/><br/>\n<img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/digital-lockers.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>In the curious information of Korea, today I saw Korean public toilets and on the street I notice a golden mark in bronze, later I figure out they that to mark where are cables for phone, power lines of fiber optical to know where are located to do any inspection in the proper place.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/cable-indicator.png\"/>\n<br/><br/>\n<img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/korea-public-toilets.jpg\"/></p>\n<h2 id=\"walking\">Walking</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (steps)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Seoul (today)</td>\n<td>15.053</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>329.257</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>344.310</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n","updatedAt":"2017-09-05T17:40:56.000Z"}
