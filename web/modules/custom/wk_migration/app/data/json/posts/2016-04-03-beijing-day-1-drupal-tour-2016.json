Before landed in Beijing I was a little worried about the quality of air, but, until now I have been so luck; because after two days I have been a good quality of air and almost an APEC blue sky, I still have 8 more days here so I will see how lucky I am.</p>\n<p>Yesterday in the morning I was a little frustrated, due my hotel internet connection sucks, and I canâ€™t determine how to reach famous sightseeing places in Beijing, so, I decided to sleep a bit more and just leave my hotel ready to attend the Drupal Meetup in Beijing.</p>\n<p>The Drupal community was receptive, taking into account that the event was on a Saturday afternoon, and we are in the middle of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qingming_Festival\">Qingming Festival</a></p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/beijing-meetup.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>Besides me, a local business owner presents about some Drupal projects he is working.</p>\n<p>As you can imagine, we went to take an early dinner or a late lunch in my case, as always delicious food.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/beijing-meetup-dinner.jpg\"/></p>\n<h2 id=\"walking\">Walking</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (steps)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Beijing (today)</td>\n<td>8.793</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>622.078</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>630.871</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n","updatedAt":"2017-09-05T17:40:56.000Z"}
