It’s a big airport. My first mistake was passed security so soon, inside Terminal B there are not a food court, and the options available were upscale, and the worst was there wasn’t free internet there. So my recommendation is to verify if there is a food court available outside secure zone and maybe free wifi.</p>\n<p>I choose to fly to Mumbai, India using AirIndia in a nonstop flight of 13 hours and 40 minutes, sounds a lot but was the shorter I found. The embarking process was a little mess due the airline doesn’t have passenger divided into zones so was like in the good old times everybody trying to get in first.</p>\n<p>I bought some snacks just in case. But, I have to say they provide us a dinner and two breakfast, the dinner was Indian food and was really good I could say the best food I tried in an airplane.</p>\n<p>The vessel was a Boeing 777 totally packed without turbulences. But, in a long flight is inevitable to feel a little uncomfortable, we landed 30 minutes before</p>\n<p>In border control, my experience was really good. Because I have to require an e-visa to visit India, I have to use the designed section for that and guess what only two persons, meanwhile the queue for nationals and tourist from countries with free entry were enormous.</p>\n<p>Looks like the airport has free wifi, but require you provide a phone number and they send a code to your phone number, so if you don’t enable roaming in your plan, you are screw.</p>\n<p>Passing customs, I have to face the first source of scam around the world, Taxis. I was informed that there are companies inside who provide prepaid services. In my terminal, I found two one with the label prepaid taxi and other without that label.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/prepaid-taxi.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>The company with the label prepaid, inform to me that the price to Powai was 310 rupees almost 5 USD dollars, and they don’t receive any foreign currency.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the other company said the price is base on taxi meter, but after request they said 800 rupees almost 260% more, but they receive USA dollars. So, I decide just change money to take the first company.</p>\n<p>After paying they give you a receive and then you have to find the taxi inside a parking lot area for taxis near to the exit door. I order a non-AC taxi as you can see in the following picture</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/taxis-area.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>When I found the cab, the first problem the driver doesn’t understand a word of English, I show him my receipt, and that say Powai and he said OK moving his head with their traditional way to say yes and no at the same time.</p>\n<p>Leaving the airport looks like all taxi drivers have to stop and go out the car maybe they have to pay a fee when my taxi driver returns he asked me for a phone number to call to ask the address, and then they talk in Hindi and everybody was happy.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/mumbai-tuk-tuk.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>The traffic looks crazy and in any NatGeo program about India, everybody was honking, sounds like the rules have an enormous gray area, but people didn’t stress a lot, so the system just works for them. After 40 minutes I get my place safe &amp; sound.</p>\n<p>To end my day I decided to try a small restaurant near to my Airbnb, recommended by my host caretaker, 50% of waiters were barefoot, but when you are in Rome…</p>\n<p>I order a Coconut soup with coriander, lamb using Dhaba style and lemon rice, total 270 rupees.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/coconut-soup.png\"/>\n<img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/lamb-lemon-rice.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>In general a good experience.</p>\n<h2 id=\"airplane\">Airplane</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (Kilometers)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>NYC &#8594; Mumbai - India</td>\n<td>12.552</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>3.575</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>16.127</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n","updatedAt":"2017-09-05T17:40:56.000Z"}
