{"layout":"post","title":"Bali Day 3 - Drupal Tour 2016","categories":["Articles"],"tags":["Travel","Enzotour16","Bali","Indonesia"],"body":"<p>I have to confess that I am a little anxious to meet with my wife again in Australia tomorrow and then in few days departure to home.</p>\n<p>Despite my homesick, I still try to enjoy alone Bali. I went out to a tourist trap named “Turtle Island” where I have to rent a boat to go to a kind of zoo, I complain about the price and treat to leave the place, and immediately they give 50% of the price. To be honest was fair because I use the boat alone.</p>\n<p>In the “island” or “zoo” they have turtles or course, iguanas, snakes, owls, among others animals.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/turtle-island-1.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/turtle-island-2.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/turtle-island-3.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>In the second place, I visited the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garuda_Wisnu_Kencana\">Garuda Wisnu Kencana (GWK)</a> cultural park; I place where you can take some pictures of those mythological goods of Indonesia culture and learn about their legend.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/gwk-1.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/gwk-2.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>At last, but not least; I visit the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uluwatu_Temple\">Uluwatu Temple</a>, where the less important think is the temple. The temple is close and what I could see is in bad shape. But, the view, oh the view, was utterly breathtaking, with the breeze, cliffs and a road along the cliffs. A place to visit if you are in Bali.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/uluwatu-1.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/uluwatu-2.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/uluwatu-3.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"{{site.url }}/assets/img/uluwatu-4.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>Ahh there are also a lot of monkeys, and they try to robbery people stuff, but only if you pay attention to them, I just walk ignoring them and done.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bus-car\">Bus/Car</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (Kilometers)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Today</td>\n<td>67</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>1.130</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>1.197</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"walking\">Walking</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (steps)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Bali (today)</td>\n<td>11.556</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>1.246.600</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>1.258.156</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n","updatedAt":"2017-09-05T17:40:56.000Z"}
