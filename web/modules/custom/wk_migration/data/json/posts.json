To enable this kind of comunication is necessary implement “cross-domain” requests would otherwise be forbidden by web browsers, per the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy\">same origin security policy</a>.</p>\n<p>Lets imagine the following scenery: we have a frontend application using the domain <a href=\"http://a.com\">http://a.com</a> and this application wants to use data provided by a  backend site located in domain <a href=\"http://b.com\">http://b.com</a>. For security this type of communication is blocked and the end user will be only able to get the information from <a href=\"http://a.com\">http://a.com</a>, this scenario is exemplified in the following image.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/crossdomain.png\"/></p>\n<p>To enable this kind of communication is requiered that your backed server (http//b.com) returns the specific HTTP Headers to enable CORS comunication.

      "draft": false,
      "body": "<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://requirejs.org/\">RequireJS</a> is a JavaScript library that allows us to isolate the components of our JS application as modules and resolve their dependencies.</p>\n<p>RequireJS implements the design pattern of software <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_module_definition\">AMD</a> (Asynchronous Module Definition) which you could say is very similar to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection\">Dependency injection</a> implemented by frameworks like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://symfony.com/\">Symfony</a>.</p>\n<p>Let’s check how we can use in our JS application in simple steps.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1-define-entry-point-for-requirejs-\">1. Define entry point for RequireJS.</h2>\n<p>We must download the lastest version of RequireJS library available on the website <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://requirejs.org\">http://requirejs.org</a>, after download will put in a directory called libs just for purposes of this example (tested with version 2.1.11).</p>\n<p>Now we need to  define a html file and could named index.html where RequireJS is loading as shown below.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n  &lt;script data-main=&quot;libs/main&quot; src=&quot;libs/require.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre><p>As you can see the inclusión is done with the script tag at the end of the HTML tag body, but it could also be done within the head tag.</p>\n<p>It’s also possible to include RequireJS remotely using the URL <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://requirejs.org/docs/release/2.1.11/minified/require.js\">http://requirejs.org/docs/release/2.1.11/minified/require.js</a> or similar, but it is a desition of the reader.</p>\n<p>As can be seen RequireJS  use the meta-data property <em>data-main</em>(, with this property we can define the entry point for RequireJS configuration, which is a relative path for the file we choose to load teh RequireJS configuraton (is necesarry exlude the js extension).</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-configure-requirejs\">2. Configure RequireJS</h2>\n<p>In the file libs/main.js we define the RequireJS options. The first thing we should to define is which JS libraries will use in our application as shown below.</p>\n<pre><code>require.config({\n    baseUrl: &#39;libs&#39;,\n    paths : {\n      backbone : &#39;backbone&#39;,\n      underscore : &#39;underscore&#39;,\n      jquery : &#39;jquery&#39;,\n      marionette : &#39;backbone.marionette&#39;,\n      wreqr : &#39;backbone.wreqr&#39;,\n      eventbinder : &#39;backbone.eventbinder&#39;,\n      babysitter : &#39;backbone.babysitter&#39;\n  }\n});\n</code></pre><p>All files are seek in the directory defined using the <em>baseUrl</em> property, and the <em>paths</em> property allow define the location of the libraries required with a key to refer to the library later. The js extension is not required and will be added by RequireJS later.</p>\n<p>As its name suggests the pattern AMD makes an asynchronous load of packages. But because not all the libraries implement the AMD pattern, is likely to a library A try to use a function defined in library B not yet loaded causing a fatal error.</p>\n<p>To resolve this issue we use the property <em>Shim</em> part of  RequireJS configuration, as we see below.</p>\n<pre><code>require.config({,\n  shim : {\n    jquery : {\n      exports : &#39;jQuery&#39;\n    },\n    underscore : {\n      exports : &#39;_&#39;\n    },\n    backbone : {\n      deps : [&#39;jquery&#39;, &#39;underscore&#39;],\n      exports : &#39;Backbone&#39;\n    },\n    wreqr: {\n      deps : [&#39;backbone&#39;]\n    },\n    eventbinder : {\n      deps : [&#39;backbone&#39;]\n    },\n    babysitter : {\n      deps: [&#39;backbone&#39;]\n    },\n    marionette : {\n      deps: [&#39;wreqr&#39;, &#39;eventbinder&#39;, &#39;babysitter&#39;],\n      exports : &#39;Marionette&#39;\n    }\n  }\n});\n</code></pre><p>Using Shim we can define dependencies between libraries and allow to export global variables that can be used within other libraries such as jQuery library which  export  the variable jQuery.</p>\n<p>The configuration with the Shim is a replacement for Order plugin used before version 2.0 of RequireJS.</p>\n<p>The exports variable can also be an anonymous function to return the call noConflict function, if the library supports it.</p>\n<p>Using the <em>deps</em> property, you can define multiple dependencies of libraries should be loaded before including the library that are defining, such as backbone that depends on jquery and underscore to be used.</p>\n<p>Of course if we want to use the library with RequireJS  and supports AMD configuration pattern Shim isn’t required.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-how-to-execute-code-required-\">3. How to execute code required.</h2>\n<p>Once defined libraries and its dependencies if necessary, we can now rewrite the code we need as shown below.</p>\n<pre><code>// Loading dependences and execute Marionette App\nrequire( [&quot;marionette&quot;], function (Marionette) {\n    // set up the app instance\n    var MyApp = new Marionette.Application();\n\n    MyApp.on(&quot;initialize:after&quot;, function(){\n      alert(&quot;Application has started!&quot;);\n    });\n\n    MyApp.start();\n});\n</code></pre><p>The above code checks that all the libraries needed to run Marionette are loaded before executing the code and get the exported global variable as a parameter.</p>\n<p>In the anonymous function will create a Marionette Application and start it, As result we  will get an alert with the message “Application has started”.</p>\n<p>The require function has the same effect of an anonymous function, meaning that run without problems but can not be used later.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4-how-to-create-named-modules-\">4. How to create named modules.</h2>\n<p>If we want encapsulate our App we must create named modules using the funcion <em>define</em>; The diference with require function is  an extra parameter that is used to name the module and returns an object or variable that will be used when the module is instantiated.</p>\n<p>Then consider the previous example as a named module.</p>\n<pre><code>define( &#39;MyApp&#39;, [&quot;marionette&quot;], function (Marionette) {\n\n    // set up the app instance\n    var MyApp = new Marionette.Application();\n\n    MyApp.on(&quot;initialize:after&quot;, function(){\n      alert(&quot;Application has started!&quot;);\n    });\n\n    // export the app from this module\n    return MyApp;\n});\n\n// Fetch and execute Marionette App\nrequire( [&quot;MyApp&quot;], function (MyApp) {\n    // Execute App\n    MyApp.start();\n});\n</code></pre><p>As you see we register a named module <em>MyApp</em> and  returns an object defined in Marionette.</p>\n<p>Then with a <em>require</em> function the module is loaded, it receives as parameters the object returns by the module and can thus start our application.</p>\n<p>It might seem a waste of time doing it this way as it is in the same file, but the idea is to create a module for file and using the configuration of RequireJS load all the libraries that define modules and then use these modules in our application.</p>\n<p>You can download the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/projects/marionettejs_skeleton_app\">Marionette App Skeleton</a> repository which implements the concepts discussed here.</p>\n<p>I hope you have been to his liking.</p>\n",

Router Module.</h1>\n<p>MarionetteJS  implements the object <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/blob/master/docs/marionette.approuter.md\">Marionette.AppRouter</a> that allows you to define the paths that respond to your application. Using <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://requirejs.org/\">RequireJS</a> we can create a module that defines an object for our routes, also allows us to create multiple  Route objects that can be instantiated for other applications by convenience.</p>\n<p>In our application we create a folder where modules live, named modules. See an example definition of a Route.</p>\n<pre><code>define([&quot;marionette&quot;], function (Marionette) {\n  var Router = Marionette.AppRouter.extend({\n    appRoutes: {\n      &quot;&quot;: &quot;home&quot;,\n    },\n    /* standard routes can be mixed with appRoutes/Controllers above */\n    routes : {\n      &quot;hello/:username&quot;: &quot;helloBuddy&quot;\n    },\n    helloBuddy : function (buddy) {\n      // Without controller the routing functions live in Router object\n      alert(&quot;Hello &quot; + buddy);\n    }\n  });\n\n  return Router;\n});\n</code></pre><p>As you can see the code has an anonymus definition that returns a Router object, which then will be required for our application.</p>\n<p>Then we must define the properties that are response functions of our application routes.</p>\n<p><em>AppRoutes</em>: Property that allows the definition of routes with convention: URL : Method Name, the method must be defined in the Controller module that is associated with the Route within the application. This option allows the response functions change dramatically, depending on the controller being involved in Route.</p>\n<p><em>routes</em>: Property that defines routes, but unlike the previous methods will be defined within the Router object. This option ensures that certain (s) routes have a specific desired behavior.</p>\n<p>Both properties can be used in the same definition without problem, but the routes should not be repeated.</p>\n<p>When the application starts the Router indicate which methods are executed in response to a route visited by a user.</p>\n<p>In the definition of Route we use the property routes with dynamic parameters. in the  route hello:username, username is a dynamic value passed as a parameter to the method of response to the route.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-controller-module-\">2. Controller Module.</h2>\n<p>In the same way we did  for Routing will create a module for the controller, as shown below</p>\n<pre><code>define([&quot;marionette&quot;], function (Marionette) {\n\n    var Controller = Marionette.Controller.extend({\n        initialize : function(options) {\n             //TODO: code to initialize\n         },\n        start: function() {\n            //TODO: code to start\n        },\n\n        /**\n         * Initialized on start, without hash\n         * @method\n         */\n         home :  function () {\n            alert(&#39;Hello Marionette&#39;);\n        },\n    });\n\n    return Controller;\n});\n</code></pre><p>This module is anonymous and extend the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/blob/master/docs/marionette.controller.md\">Marionette.Controller</a> object as seen have initialize and start methods to perform tasks that are required at the time of the creation of the controller.</p>\n<p>Then you must define the properties that are response functions of our application routes. In our case we define the hello method.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-invoking-controller-and-router\">3. Invoking Controller  and Router</h2>\n<p>When we declare our application we load the objects that define the Router and Controller, as shown below.</p>\n<pre><code>// Loading dependences and module to execute Marionette App\nrequire( [&quot;marionette&quot;,&quot;../modules/AppRouter&quot;, &quot;../modules/AppController&quot;], function (Marionette, AppRouter, AppController) {\n    // set up the app instance\n    var MyApp = new Marionette.Application();\n\n    // initialize the app controller\n    var controller = new AppController({});\n\n    // initialize the app router\n    MyApp.addInitializer(function(options) {\n        // initialize the router\n        var router = new AppRouter({\n          controller : controller\n        });\n    });\n\n    MyApp.on(&quot;initialize:after&quot;, function(){\n      // Start Backbone history a necessary step for bookmarkable URL&#39;s\n      Backbone.history.start();\n    });\n\n    MyApp.start({});\n});\n</code></pre><p>Although Route and Controller modules were anonymous, using RequireJS we can do load modules using the relative path of the modules as shown in detail in the next line.</p>\n<pre><code>require( [&quot;marionette&quot;,&quot;../modules/AppRouter&quot;, &quot;../modules/AppController&quot;], function (Marionette, AppRouter, AppController) {\n</code></pre><p>The returned objects are passed as a parameter to the anonymous function that defines the application.</p>\n<p>As seen proceeds to create an instance of the Controller object, which will be later used in the definition of the Router.</p>\n<pre><code>// initialize the app controller\nvar controller = new AppController({});\n</code></pre><p>In the initialization of our MarionetteJS application, we create the Router using the Controller.</p>\n<pre><code>// initialize the app router\nMyApp.addInitializer(function(options) {\n  // initialize the router\n  var router = new AppRouter({\n    controller : controller\n  });\n});\n</code></pre><p>Finally after finishing the initialization of our application should be activated BackboneJS history of what that will activate the process of routing.</p>\n<pre><code>MyApp.on(&quot;initialize:after&quot;, function(){\n  // Start Backbone history a necessary step for bookmarkable URL&#39;s\n  Backbone.history.start();\n});\n</code></pre><p>When it loads the application we will getan alert with the message “Hello Marionette” and if you change the URL to index.html#hello/ enzo you will get a resul similar to the following output.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://7sabores.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/marionette_routing_sample.png?itok=2lla5O-u\"/></p>\n",

The idea is that all of those routine tasks that we do in our projects Grunt make them for us. Among the most common tasks are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Concat files (CSS, JS, etc)</li>\n<li>Minify files (CSS, JS, etc)</li>\n<li>Optimize images.</li>\n<li>Compilation (SASS -&gt; CSS and others)</li>\n<li>Unit Test</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each of these tasks is implemented by a Grunt plugin, which today has nearly three thousand plugins, you can see the full list of plugins in <a targe=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gruntjs.com/plugins\">http://gruntjs.com/plugins</a>.</p>\n<p>Grunt is built with is Javascript  and require <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nodejs.org/\">Node.js</a> to be executed which makes Grunt multi platform.</p>\n<p>##How install Grunt.</p>\n<p>As I said earlier Grunt uses Node.js to run, but you don’t need to know anything about Node.js to use Grunt, is only required to install and execute, it in the same way we you don’t need to know Java to run programs that use the Java JRE.</p>\n<p>The first is to install Node.js, you can find an installer for your platform at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nodejs.org/download/\">http://nodejs.org/download/</a>.</p>\n<p>After install Node.js we will have NPM (Node Packaged Modules) available, NPM allows us to install packages, all packages available are listed in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.npmjs.org\">https://www.npmjs.org</a>. Right now there are almost 80,000 packages and one of them is Grunt.</p>\n<p>Now we have to install the package <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.npmjs.org/package/grunt-cli\">grunt-cli</a>, grunt-cli is a command line interface to interact with grunt. Use the following command to install it.</p>\n<pre><code>npm install grunt-cli -g\n</code></pre><p>The -g option indicates that the package will be install in overall system instead of local.</p>\n<p>Now to install the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.npmjs.org/package/grunt\">grunt</a> package to execute tasks we have two options.</p>\n<h3 id=\"defining-package-json\">Defining package.json</h3>\n<p>In our application we need to create a file named <em>package.json</em> that will read by the npm command:</p>\n<pre><code>{\n  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;example-project&quot;,\n  &quot;version&quot;: &quot;0.1.0&quot;,\n  &quot;devDependencies&quot;: {\n    &quot;grunt&quot;: &quot;~0.4.1&quot;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre><p>Then run the command:</p>\n<pre><code>$ npm install\n</code></pre><p>The previous command will read and process the package.json file; installing grunt and his dependencies. Generating an output similar to the following list:</p>\n<pre><code>grunt@0.4.5 node_modules/grunt\n├── which@1.0.5\n├── dateformat@1.0.2-1.2.3\n├── eventemitter2@0.4.13\n├── getobject@0.1.0\n├── rimraf@2.2.8\n├── colors@0.6.2\n├── hooker@0.2.3\n├── async@0.1.22\n├── grunt-legacy-util@0.2.0\n├── exit@0.1.2\n├── lodash@0.9.2\n├── coffee-script@1.3.3\n├── underscore.string@2.2.1\n├── iconv-lite@0.2.11\n├── nopt@1.0.10 (abbrev@1.0.5)\n├── minimatch@0.2.14 (sigmund@1.0.0, lru-cache@2.5.0)\n├── grunt-legacy-log@0.1.1 (underscore.string@2.3.3, lodash@2.4.1)\n├── findup-sync@0.1.3 (lodash@2.4.1, glob@3.2.11)\n├── glob@3.1.21 (inherits@1.0.0, graceful-fs@1.2.3)\n└── js-yaml@2.0.5 (esprima@1.0.4, argparse@0.1.15)\n</code></pre><p>Grunt and his dependencies remain within the node_modules folder and our directory tree will be similar to the following list:</p>\n<pre><code>$ tree -L 3\n.\n├── node_modules\n│   └── grunt\n│       ├── CONTRIBUTING.md\n│       ├── LICENSE-MIT\n│       ├── README.md\n│       ├── appveyor.yml\n│       ├── internal-tasks\n│       ├── lib\n│       ├── node_modules\n│       └── package.json\n└── package.json\n</code></pre><h3 id=\"generate-dependencies-in-package-json\">Generate dependencies in package.json</h3>\n<p>If you do not know which version of Grunt we need, we can request to NPM to auto generated grunt dependencies and store in package.json file. We have to create a create a generic package.json file as shown below:</p>\n<pre><code>{\n  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;example-project&quot;,\n  &quot;version&quot;: &quot;0.1.0&quot;,\n  &quot;devDependencies&quot;: {\n  }\n}\n</code></pre><p>Now run the installation of grunt informing we want auto generate dependencies as shown in the following command:</p>\n<pre><code>$ npm install grunt --save-dev\n</code></pre><p>After installing grunt and his dependencies our archive package.json will look similar to below:</p>\n<pre><code>{\n  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;example-project&quot;,\n  &quot;version&quot;: &quot;0.1.0&quot;,\n  &quot;devDependencies&quot;: {\n    &quot;grunt&quot;: &quot;^0.4.5&quot;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre><h2 id=\"how-to-create-grunt-tasks-\">How to create Grunt Tasks.</h2>\n<p>At this point we have everything you need to start building tasks you want to use, the first thing to do is create a Gruntfile.js file to define the tasks to automate.</p>\n<p>Let’s check a minimum file Grunt.</p>\n<pre><code>&#39;use strict&#39;;\n\nmodule.exports = function (grunt) {\n\n    grunt.initConfig({\n        pkg: grunt.file.readJSON(&#39;package.json&#39;),\n    });\n\n    // Where we tell Grunt we plan to use some plug-ins.\n    //grunt.loadNpmTasks(&#39;grunt-contrib-xxxx&#39;);\n\n\n    // Where we tell Grunt what to do when we type &quot;grunt&quot; into the terminal.\n    //grunt.registerTask(&#39;default&#39;, [&#39;xxxx&#39;]);\n};\n</code></pre><p>As seen the file has 3 sections.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Initconfig: In this area we define tasks to be execute by Grunt</li>\n<li>LoadNpmTask: You should make a proper load plugin for the tasks we wish to define.</li>\n<li>RegisterTask: We must register the tasks to be run, they can be less than defined tasks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"install-grunt-plugin-\">Install Grunt plugin.</h3>\n<p>As an example we will install the plugin <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-concat\">concat</a> to merge files, run the following command inside the folder of your project.</p>\n<pre><code>$ npm install grunt-contrib-concat --save-dev\n</code></pre><p>The option - save-dev  amending package.json to add the dependency in file.</p>\n<h3 id=\"plugin-usage-\">Plugin usage.</h3>\n<p>With the plugin concat installed, now we just have to configure in Gruntfile.js file as shown below.</p>\n<pre><code>&#39;use strict&#39;;\n\nmodule.exports = function (grunt) {\n\n    grunt.initConfig({\n        pkg: grunt.file.readJSON(&#39;package.json&#39;),\n        concat: {\n            dist: {\n                src: [\n                    &#39;js/libs/*.js&#39;, // All JS in the libs folder\n                    &#39;/js/global.js&#39;  // This specific file\n                ],\n                dest: &#39;/js/build/production.js&#39;,\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\n    // Where we tell Grunt we plan to use some plug-ins.\n    grunt.loadNpmTasks(&#39;grunt-contrib-concat&#39;);\n\n    // Where we tell Grunt what to do when we type &quot;grunt&quot; into the terminal.\n    grunt.registerTask(&#39;default&#39;, [&#39;concat&#39;]);\n};\n</code></pre><p>With this definition we indicate where the files are and where we want the concatenate file be stored, then we load the NPM package and finally register the task.</p>\n<p>As you can see on the origin of the files to be concatenated we can use the special character * to define a large group of files.</p>\n<h3 id=\"execute-task-\">Execute task.</h3>\n<p>To run the task we just use one of the following commands:</p>\n<pre><code>$ grunt\n\n$ grunt concat\n</code></pre><p>The first command runs all available tasks and the second specifies the concat task, as we only have one tasks the result will be the same and we will get an output similar to the following.</p>\n<pre><code>Running &quot;concat:dist&quot; (concat) task\nFile &quot;web/js/build/production.js&quot; created.\n\nDone, without errors.\n</code></pre><p>We can continue increasing our tasks, for instance use output of concat to add a task to minify the file.</p>\n<p>All depends on what you need, the limit are  plugins available in grunt (nearly 3,000) and the needs of your project.</p>\n<p>I hope you have been to his liking.</p>\n",

It presents a menu to choose which version you want to use.</p>\n<p>Now if you ask what kind of packages are available, ranging from packets like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/jquery/jquery\">jQuery</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap\">Bootstrap</a> to <a target=\"_blank\"href=\"https://github.com/torvalds/linux\">Linux</a>. All depends on what are our project needs, today bower has nearly fourteen thousand packages.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-install-bower-\">How to install Bower.</h2>\n<p>Bower is a npm package therefore <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://npmjs.org/\">Node.js</a> is needed, with the following command we can install Bower.</p>\n<pre><code>$ npm install -g bower\n</code></pre><p>With the above command bower would be available to all system users.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-use-bower-\">How to use Bower.</h2>\n<p>Once Bower is installed you can use immediately in your application to download the packages you want, let’s say you need jQuery in your project, well you only need to use the following command to include it.</p>\n<pre><code>$ bower install jQuery\n</code></pre><p>The above command will have the following output, which informs us that versión of jQuery was downloaded.</p>\n<pre><code>bower cached        git://github.com/jquery/jquery.git#2.1.1\nbower validate      2.1.1 against git://github.com/jquery/jquery.git#*\nbower install       jQuery#2.1.1\n</code></pre><p>If you’re wondering where jQuery is installed in the directory where you run the command, you would have a structure similar to the following representation:</p>\n<pre><code>.\n└── bower_components\n    └── jQuery\n        ├── MIT-LICENSE.txt\n        ├── bower.json\n        ├── dist\n        └── src\n</code></pre><p>You see you get the minimized version of jQuery and files for normal development of jQuery is up to us to decide what files must be include in our application.</p>\n<p>If you want a specific package version you must provide this information in the install process as shown in the following command:</p>\n<pre><code>$ bower install &lt;package&gt;#&lt;version&gt;\n</code></pre><h2 id=\"group-project-dependencies-\">Group project dependencies.</h2>\n<p>As we saw is quite easy to add new components, but it depends on someone memory  to install the required packages, to define all the required packages for our project we use the bower.json file.</p>\n<p>Fortunately bower provides us a command that lets you create a basic bower.json file, you can see an output of interactive command <em>$ bower init</em>.</p>\n<pre><code>$ bower init\n[?] name: MegaProject\n[?] version: 0.1.0-alpha\n[?] description: Not Available\n[?] main file: assets/js/main.js, assets/css/main.css\n[?] what types of modules does this package expose?\n[?] keywords: HTML5\n[?] authors: enzo - Eduardo Garcia &lt;enzo@anexusit.com&gt;\n[?] license: MIT\n[?] homepage: \n[?] set currently installed components as dependencies? Yes\n[?] add commonly ignored files to ignore list? Yes\n[?] would you like to mark this package as private which prevents it from being [?] would you like to mark this package as private which prevents it from being accidentally published to the registry? No\n</code></pre><p>This command above will generate a file called bower.json with the following content.</p>\n<pre><code>{\n  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;MegaProject&quot;,\n  &quot;version&quot;: &quot;0.1.0-alpha&quot;,\n  &quot;authors&quot;: [\n    &quot;enzo - Eduardo Garcia &lt;enzo@anexusit.com&gt;&quot;\n  ],\n  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Not Available&quot;,\n  &quot;main&quot;: &quot;assets/js/main.js, assets/css/main.css&quot;,\n  &quot;keywords&quot;: [\n    &quot;HTML5&quot;\n  ],\n  &quot;license&quot;: &quot;MIT&quot;,\n  &quot;homepage&quot;: &quot;&quot;,\n  &quot;ignore&quot;: [\n    &quot;**/.*&quot;,\n    &quot;node_modules&quot;,\n    &quot;bower_components&quot;,\n    &quot;test&quot;,\n    &quot;tests&quot;\n  ],\n  &quot;dependencies&quot;: {\n    &quot;jQuery&quot;: &quot;~2.1.1&quot;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre><p>Now what advantage we get from file bower.js file? The first one is portability because we just need put this file in our version control system and when a new developer arrive to team for sure we will need set up his environment; then he just need download the bower.json and run the following command:</p>\n<pre><code>$ bower install\n</code></pre><p>In this case bower detects the existence of a bower.json file and will proceed to install packages included in the file, allowing us to maintain our system clean and avoid having stored 50 versions of jQuery when in the end we are interested in last version of jQuery.</p>\n<h2 id=\"specify-destination-packages-\">Specify destination packages.</h2>\n<p>As we saw before the default destination is <em>bower_components</em> folder, but it is very likely that this location is not to our liking, if we want to specify a custom destination folder we need to create a file .bowerrc to inform bower about our needs, as shown below.</p>\n<pre><code>{\n    &quot;directory&quot;: &quot;web/vendor&quot;\n}\n</code></pre><p>Which will make the packets are stored in the folder <em>web/vendor</em> or any other you want.</p>\n<p>I hope you have been to his liking.</p>\n",

The MD extension stands for MarkDown which is a series of dialing rules that will generate a HTML without knowing HTML for tags like bold, subtitle and other special labels in a similar way to that done by <a href=\"http://wikipedia.org\">http://wikipedia.org</a>.</p>\n<p>If you want to know a little more about MarkDown you can check the version of Github at <a href=\"https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown\">https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown</a> and BitBucket version at  <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/tutorials/markdowndemo\">https://bitbucket.org/tutorials/markdowndemo</a>.</p>\n<p>When we have mastered the MarkDown creating sections within our document, the natural evolution is to make a table of contents to make it easier to navigate through Readme file doing our project more professional, but this task can be cumbersome luckily we will see below a tool that does this job for us.</p>\n<p>#Install DocToc</p>\n<p>Assuming you have Node.js installed in your system and therefore the npm command is available run the following command to install the DocToc project.</p>\n<pre><code>$ npm install -g doctoc\n</code></pre><p>#Generating TOC</p>\n<p>Once installed we just need to indicate on which files we are going to generate the TOC.

      "body": "<p>In the blog entry <a href=\"/articles/2014/06/18/introduction-to-grunt/\">Introduction to Grunt</a> I  explained how we could use Grunt to automate tasks, but the only way to detect the available tasks is review the Gruntfile.js file or perform the tasks, but it’s not be a good idea execute tasks that do not know what they do .</p>\n<p>Fortunately there is a plugin that allows  Grunt toe review tasks available, this plugin is <a href=\"https://github.com/ben-eb/grunt-available-tasks\">grunt-available-tasks</a>. Lets see how we can implement it in our  project.</p>\n<p>#Install plugin.</p>\n<p>The first thing to do is install the plugin available-tasks running assuming you have npm installed just execute the following command.</p>\n<pre><code>$ npm install grunt-available-tasks --save-dev\n</code></pre><p>The above command will add the respective dependency in your package.json file and you will get a similar entry to the following file.</p>\n<pre><code>&quot;grunt-available-tasks&quot;:&quot;0.5.0&quot;\n</code></pre><p>#Add task to Grunt.</p>\n<p>Having as base the file <strong>Gruntfile.js</strong> created in previous entry “Introduction to Grunt” we will include the necessary configuration to add the task to list the available tasks as shown below.</p>\n<pre><code>availabletasks: {\n  tasks: {\n    options: {\n      filter: &#39;exclude&#39;,\n      tasks: [&#39;availabletasks&#39;, &#39;tasks&#39;]\n    }\n  }              \n},\n</code></pre><p>The above action registers the configuration for the plugin <strong>available-tasks</strong> indicating that we want to exclude from the list of tasks “availabletasks” and “tasks “ the last one  is an alias to configure later.</p>\n<p>#Load the plugin.</p>\n<p>In order to execute the comand availabletasks/tasks we have load the plugin with the following settings Gruntfile.js close the end of file as shown in the following listing</p>\n<pre><code>grunt.loadNpmTasks(&#39;grunt-available-tasks&#39;);\n</code></pre><p>#Register the task.</p>\n<p>Finally lets register the task using an alias to facilitate their implementation, for which we just add the following code at the end of the configuration file.</p>\n<pre><code>grunt.registerTask(&#39;tasks&#39;, [&#39;availabletasks&#39;]);\n</code></pre><p>#Run the command</p>\n<p>At this point we could get the tasks available and should just run the following command.</p>\n<pre><code>$ grunt tasks\n</code></pre><p>The above command would get an output  similar to the following image.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/grunt-tasks.png\"/></p>\n<p>The image above was executed within the project <a href=\"https://github.com/enzolutions/community-bookstore\">Community Bookstore</a>.

      "body": "<p>In few months we will get the new release of Drupal the #8 (I hope) and I think it’s time to start to test, learn and write about the new ways we have in Drupal 8 to do our old tricks.</p>\n<p>Today I want to talk about the Drupal 8 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://drupal8cmi.org/\">Initiative Configuration Management</a>, this initiative pretend to facilitate the process of pass Site Building stuffs from Dev environments to Production.</p>\n<p>As you can imagine this feature will be a replacement of Drupal <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/features\">Features</a> and if you don’t use or don’t like Features also will be a replacement for Drupal <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/bundle_copy\">Bundle Copy</a></p>\n<p>#Installing Drupal 8</p>\n<p>Right now there isn’t an official Drupal release for Drupal 8, but if you can start to test you can get directly from git repository.</p>\n<p>If you don’t have plans to contribute with code to Drupal 8 you can use the following command to get just the latest version of Drupal 8 but without the whole git history reducing dramatically the download process.</p>\n<pre><code>git clone -depth 1 --branch 8.0.x http://git.drupal.org/project/drupal.git [FOLDER_NAME]\n</code></pre><p>After that you just need create a Database and point your webserver to this folder and start the installation in the same way you usually do for Drupal 7.</p>\n<p>#Configuration Management Install</p>\n<p>You don’t need install Configuration Management module, because is part of Drupal 8 Core and is already installed when you complete a standard Drupal 8 installation, as you can see in the following image.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/configuration_management_module_enable.png\"/></p>\n<p>As you can imagine, you can’t disable the Configuration Management module.</p>\n<p>#Export Configuration</p>\n<p>As I said at the beginning Configuration Management is a replacement for Features, so you need to work in your website doing Site Building tasks like creating or modifying content types and other tasks like creating Views(part of Drupal 8 Core).</p>\n<p>Now we will call the first Drupal 8 Installation <strong>Devel#1</strong> of a new Drupal 8 project and as you can imagine we need to share our progress with the rest of team and to avoid to create a DB Dump and force the rest of the team import we will use the Configuration Management.</p>\n<p>The administrator of <strong>Devel#1</strong> has to go page: example.com/admin/config/development/configuration/full/export the UI will looks similar to image below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/configuration_management_full_export.png\"></p>\n<p>After press the button Export you will get a zip file named <strong>config.tar.gz</strong>, after you uncompress the zip file you will get a config folder with severals files in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/yaml/yaml_format.html\">YAML</a> format and each one represent a isolate piece of configuration of our site. Below you can a partial list of files created by export.</p>\n<pre><code>block.block.bartik_footer.yml       menu.entity.node.page.yml\nblock.block.bartik_help.yml       menu_link.static.overrides.yml\nblock.block.bartik_login.yml        menu_ui.settings.yml\nblock.block.bartik_powered.yml        node.settings.yml\nblock.block.bartik_search.yml       node.type.article.yml\nblock.block.bartik_tools.yml        node.type.book.yml\nblock.block.seven_breadcrumbs.yml     node.type.page.yml\nblock.block.seven_content.yml       rdf.mapping.comment.comment.yml\nblock.block.seven_help.yml        rdf.mapping.node.article.yml\n</code></pre><p>Now we have the options to share all files or just one of them with the rest of the team.</p>\n<p>#Importing Configuration</p>\n<p>Now we have the files required to import the configuration in other Drupal installation <strong>Devel#2</strong> but we need to prepare the destination.</p>\n<p>The Drupal 8 installation process create two folders to handle the import and export process, the installer create two folders inside <DOCROOT>/sites/default/files using random names, but we can check the proper names checking our configuration at <DOCROOT>/sites/default/setting.php.</p>\n<p>Let me show you an example of that configuration file:</p>\n<pre><code>$settings[&#39;install_profile&#39;] = &#39;standard&#39;;\n$config_directories[&#39;active&#39;] = &#39;sites/default/files/config_0HU-CmGmyKok3uG6Ao8Lv4WCsVZDwqitSKnQcUNPJmtrKWdgQuM4nhQNZO_T5Mcsmaz-bFcOyA/active&#39;;\n$config_directories[&#39;staging&#39;] = &#39;sites/default/files/config_0HU-CmGmyKok3uG6Ao8Lv4WCsVZDwqitSKnQcUNPJmtrKWdgQuM4nhQNZO_T5Mcsmaz-bFcOyA/staging&#39;;\n</code></pre><p>As you can see now we have two concepts <strong>active</strong> and <strong>staging</strong>.</p>\n<p>The <strong>active</strong> folder must contain the current site configuration, but by default is empty because the default storage for current site is Database but is possible change I will write about that in other blog entry.</p>\n<p>The <strong>staging</strong> folder contain any configuration we want to import in our site, here we must copy the files we get from export process.</p>\n<p>I recommend use a version system like GIT to control the staging files and change configuration to use a non hash folder name, check my recommendation below:</p>\n<pre><code>$settings[&#39;install_profile&#39;] = &#39;standard&#39;;\n$config_directories[&#39;active&#39;] = &#39;sites/default/files/config_rK_6KVDPn-s9l-ea_L0XBN1GzJlcnrZ3CssUXn1eQ7G98viRJXesYsSdsf_KjxkCRgelximKzg/active&#39;;\n$config_directories[&#39;staging&#39;] = &#39;sites/default/config/staging&#39;;\n</code></pre><p>Is required your web server have permissions to read the configuration files, for instance if _www is the user running your web server you must run the following commands:</p>\n<pre><code>$ sudo chown -R _www sites/default/config/staging/\n$ sudo chmod -R 755 sites/default/config/staging/\n</code></pre><p>Until here all looks OK, but If you go to the page example.com/admin/config/development/configuration you will get the following error</p>\n<p><img src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/configuration_management_sync_error.png\"/></p>\n<p>We will solve this issue in next section.</p>\n<p>##Force Site UUID match</p>\n<p>The Configuration Management only allow sync configuration between same site or project to avoid issues importing configuration from site a.com to b.com, to accomplish this validation Drupal 8 generate a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/uuid\">UUID</a> for each site.</p>\n<p>You cat get your current site UUDI executing the following command</p>\n<pre><code>$ drush cget system.site\n</code></pre><p>The command above we will have a similar output to next listing</p>\n<pre><code>uuid: 236fa77c-d83e-42de-8a03-03c574c00160\nname: backend.com\nmail: enzo@enzolutions.com\nslogan: &#39;&#39;\npage:\n  403: &#39;&#39;\n  404: &#39;&#39;\n  front: node\nadmin_compact_mode: false\nweight_select_max: 100\nlangcode: en\n</code></pre><p>The config import has a different UUID, you can confirm the UID with the following command</p>\n<pre><code>$ cat sites/default/config/staging/system.site.yml\n</code></pre><p>For that reason uou need to change the value of Site UUID using the following Drush command:</p>\n<pre><code>$ drush cedit system.site\n</code></pre><p>The command above enable you to use your favorite text editor to set the same UUID present in staging config files.</p>\n<h2 id=\"run-sync\">Run Sync</h2>\n<p>After change the UUID and change the permissions, if you visit again the page example.com/admin/config/development/configuration you will see all changes, deletions, renames, and additions as you can see in the following image:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/configuration_management_sync.png\"/></p>\n<p>You can review the differences and remove some files from staging folder if you are not happy with the result and finally execute the Import All process.</p>\n<p>If you are a Drush lover you still can run this process with Drush with the following command:</p>\n<pre><code>$ drush config-import staging\n</code></pre><p>After complete the import you have now site sync.</p>\n<p>I hope you have found this article useful.</p>\n",

      "body": "<p>One of the first things we learn in a new programming language is how to  implement a command line is to read the parameters provided by user in execution, today I want to make my first blog related to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nodejs.org/\">Node.js</a> and I will show you how to make an interactive interface with Node.js.</p>\n<p>For those who are unfamiliar with the concept of interactive interfaces may refer to popular <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses\">NCurses</a> used in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU/Linux\">GNU/Linux</a> platforms.</p>\n<p>#Install Inquirer plugin.</p>\n<p>Assuming you already installed Node.js we will use npm command to install the plugin inquirer to provide us an easy way to creating an interface.</p>\n<pre><code>$ npm install inquirer\n</code></pre><p>#Create interactive script</p>\n<p>With the Inquirer plugin installed, we need to create a script called interactivo.js in which we will create our script.</p>\n<p>The first thing to do is load the library inquirer as shown below.</p>\n<pre><code>var inquirer = require(&quot;inquirer&quot;);\n</code></pre><p>To use Inquirer we just pass an array of objects with questions and an anonymous function that will process the responses received, let me show an example the format of implementation.</p>\n<pre><code>inquirer.prompt([/* Pass your questions in here */], function( answers ) {\n    // Use user feedback for... whatever!!\n});\n</code></pre><p>Now let’s see the types of questions that we can build.</p>\n<p>##Input</p>\n<p>Input type questions are simple questions that can have a default value and the response is stored in a variable equal to the name that is provided in the configuration, see the implementation.</p>\n<pre><code>{\n  type: &#39;input&#39;,\n  name: &#39;nombre&#39;,\n  message: &#39;Nombre Completo?&#39;,\n  default: &#39;Jose Perez&#39;\n},\n</code></pre><p>##Confirm</p>\n<p>The confirm questions are of the type Yes or NO let’s see an example of its implementation.</p>\n<pre><code>{ type: &#39;confirm&#39;,\n  name: &#39;casado&#39;,\n  message: &#39;Casado?&#39;,\n},\n</code></pre><p>#List</p>\n<p>The list questions allows you to select your answer from a list of predefined options, as shown below.</p>\n<pre><code>{\n  type: &quot;list&quot;,\n  name: &quot;estudios&quot;,\n  message: &quot;Nivel academico?&quot;,\n  choices: [\n    &quot;Primaria&quot;,\n    &quot;Secundaria&quot;,\n    new inquirer.Separator(),\n    &quot;Bachillerato&quot;,\n    &quot;Licenciatura&quot;,\n    &quot;Doctorado&quot;\n   ]\n},\n</code></pre><p>This type of question allows placing a separator of options as is seen in the above list.</p>\n<p>#Checkbox</p>\n<p>The checkbox questions type allows the user to check a list of options which apply in his case, as shown in the following code listing.</p>\n<pre><code>{\n  type: &quot;checkbox&quot;,\n  message: &quot;Servicios Publicos&quot;,\n  name: &quot;servicios&quot;,\n  choices: [\n    {\n      name: &quot;Agua&quot;,\n      checked: true\n    },\n    {\n      name: &quot;Luz&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      name: &quot;Internet&quot;\n    },\n    ],\n}\n</code></pre><p>#Password</p>\n<p>The password questions type as its name suggest use a mask to hide what the user is typing on the screen, let’s see an example.</p>\n<pre><code>{\n  type: &quot;password&quot;,\n  message: &quot;Enter your git password&quot;,\n  name: &quot;password&quot;\n}\n</code></pre><p>Let’s now look full implementation.</p>\n<pre><code>var inquirer = require(&quot;inquirer&quot;);\n\nvar preguntas = [\n    {\n      type: &#39;input&#39;,\n      name: &#39;nombre&#39;,\n      message: &#39;Nombre Completo?&#39;,\n      default: &#39;Jose Perez&#39;\n    },\n    { type: &#39;confirm&#39;,\n      name: &#39;casado&#39;,\n      message: &#39;Casado?&#39;,\n    },\n    { when: function (response) {\n        return response.casado;\n      },\n      type: &#39;input&#39;,\n      name: &#39;hijos&#39;,\n      message: &#39;Número de hijos?&#39;,\n    },\n    {\n    type: &quot;list&quot;,\n    name: &quot;estudios&quot;,\n    message: &quot;Nivel academico?&quot;,\n    choices: [\n      &quot;Primaria&quot;,\n      &quot;Secundaria&quot;,\n      new inquirer.Separator(),\n      &quot;Bachillerato&quot;,\n      &quot;Licenciatura&quot;,\n      &quot;Doctorado&quot;\n     ]\n    },\n    {\n    type: &quot;checkbox&quot;,\n    message: &quot;Servicios Publicos&quot;,\n    name: &quot;servicios&quot;,\n    choices: [\n      {\n        name: &quot;Agua&quot;,\n        checked: true\n      },\n      {\n        name: &quot;Luz&quot;\n      },\n      {\n        name: &quot;Internet&quot;\n      },\n      ],\n    }\n    ];\ninquirer.prompt(preguntas, function(respuestas) {\n  console.log(respuestas);\n});\n</code></pre><p>As you can see what I did was create an array with objects with the definitions of the types of questions outlined above and this arrangement is passed to inquirer.prompt function and as the second parameter an anonymous function is pass to prints the user’s responses.</p>\n<p>Within the definition of the questions the script add a bonus which is the use of when tproperty. When is a property that allows us to validate if we show or not a question validating the previous answers as shown below.</p>\n<pre><code>when: function (response) {\n  return response.casado;\n}\n</code></pre><p>#Execute the script.</p>\n<p>To run the newly created script we just run the following command line.</p>\n<pre><code>$ node interactivo.js\n</code></pre><p>Depending on user responses the result will be different, but similar to the following image.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/nodejs_interactive.png\"/></p>\n<p>I hope you have found this blog useful.</p>\n",

      "body": "<p>Nowadays Drupal 8 has couple of beta releases so the official release is around the corner. For that reason I start to test the typical features required in a Drupal 7 site.</p>\n<p>Today I will share with you my experiences with Form with Ajax effects.</p>\n<p>#Create a Form</p>\n<p>I will skip the explanation about how to create a Form in Drupal 8 because could be generated using the project <a href=\"http://drupalconsole.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Drupal Console</a> executing the following command.</p>\n<pre><code>$ php console.phar generate:form:config\n</code></pre><p>#Drupal 8 FAPI + Ajax</p>\n<p>The current documentation of FAPI for Drupal 8 about <a href=\"https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/developer!topics!forms_api_reference.html/8#ajax\" target=\"_blank\">ajax</a> is not updated.</p>\n<p>But the property is still name <strong>#ajax</strong> check the following implementation.</p>\n<pre><code>   $form[&#39;source&#39;][&#39;version&#39;] = array(\n      &#39;#type&#39; =&gt; &#39;radios&#39;,\n      &#39;#title&#39; =&gt; $this-&gt;t(&#39;Drupal Version&#39;),\n      &#39;#default_value&#39;=&gt;&quot;d6&quot;,\n      &#39;#options&#39; =&gt; $options,\n      &#39;#description&#39; =&gt; t(&#39;Choise what version of Drupal you want migrate&#39;),\n      &#39;#required&#39; =&gt; TRUE,\n      &#39;#ajax&#39; =&gt; array(\n        &#39;callback&#39; =&gt; &#39;::updateDestinationIds&#39;,\n        &#39;wrapper&#39; =&gt; &#39;edit-destinations&#39;,\n        &#39;progress&#39; =&gt; array(\n          &#39;type&#39; =&gt; &#39;throbber&#39;,\n          &#39;message&#39; =&gt; &quot;searching&quot;,\n        ),\n      ),\n    );\n</code></pre><p>If you are a old developer of Drupal you will recognize the properties <strong>wrapper</strong>, <strong>progress</strong>, these properties work equal in Drupal 7.</p>\n<p>The main change is in callback property, in my example the value ‘::updateDestinationIds’ means the method <em>updateDestinationIds</em> is part of the Form class. I didn’t test but looks like we can assign a static method like ‘Drupal::StaticMethod’.</p>\n<p>#Response method</p>\n<p>Similar to Drupal 7 the method has to return the portion of the Form must be overwritten via ajax, let me show you an example.</p>\n<pre><code>/**\n * Gets migration configurations.\n *\n * @return array\n *   An array of migration names.\n */\nfunction updateDestinationIds($form, FormStateInterface $form_state) {\n    $form [&#39;source&#39;][&#39;migration_ids&#39;][&#39;#options&#39;] = $this-&gt;getDestinationIds($form_state-&gt;getValue(&#39;version&#39;));\n    return $form [&#39;source&#39;][&#39;migration_ids&#39;];\n}\n</code></pre><p>#Known Issues</p>\n<p>After implement the Ajax function I detect a problem when I try to select values populated via Ajax and submit the form I get this error message “An illegal choice has been detected. Please contact the site administrator.”</p>\n<p>When I debug I can determine the method <a href=\"https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core!lib!Drupal!Core!Installer!Form!SiteSettingsForm.php/function/SiteSettingsForm%3A%3AbuildForm/8\" target=\"_blank\">buildForm</a> is executed in different moments listed below</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Form load</strong>: To build the form</li>\n<li><strong>Ajax request</strong>: To re-build the form and determine elements to overwrite.</li>\n<li><strong>Form submit</strong>: To process the form</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My problem was in the last one <em>Form Submit</em> because the submit run the implementation of class <a href=\"https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21lib%21Drupal%21Core%21Form%21FormValidator.php/8\" target=\"_blank\">FormValidator</a>.</p>\n<p>The FormValidator ignore the Ajax process and validate the FormState values against the list of values allowed and because took this values from buildForm they are always the initial values ignoring the user interaction.</p>\n<p>To resolve this problem I use the  <a href=\"https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21lib%21Drupal%21Core%21Form%21FormState.php/class/FormState/8\" target=\"_blank\">FormState</a> object to determine if buildForm was executed to render the form at first time or if has human interaction (ajax or submit) to define the allowed list of values based in user interaction, check the following snippet.</p>\n<pre><code>$form_state_complete_form=$form_state-&gt;getCompleteForm();\nif(empty($form_state_complete_version)){\n    $form [&#39;source&#39;][&#39;migration_ids&#39;][&#39;#options&#39;] = $this-&gt;getDestinationIds(&quot;d6&quot;);\n }\n  else  {\n   $form [&#39;source&#39;][&#39;migration_ids&#39;][&#39;#options&#39;] = $this-&gt;getDestinationIds($form_state_complete_version);\n }\n</code></pre><p>Don’t be worry about this behavior as you can see is easy to fix and I’m sure won’t be necessary when Drupal 8 get the first official release.</p>\n<p>#Caveats</p>\n<p>The current status of Drupal 8 only support the ajax update in <em>Select</em> elements, I tried with <strong>tableselect</strong> and <strong>checkboxes</strong> and doesn’t work.</p>\n<p>There is an issue for this problem at <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/node/1458824\" target=\"_blank\">Ajax doesn’t work with Tableselect with checkboxes</a>.</p>\n",

=&gt; $image_styles,\n    );\n    return $element;\n  }\n</code></pre><p>The implementation above allow user select a specific image style to be returned or just return the original image.</p>\n<p>###Summary Report</p>\n<p>Is important to inform to end users current setting of formatter, to enable that we have to implement the method <strong>settingsSummary</strong></p>\n<pre><code>/**\n   * {@inheritdoc}\n   */\n  public function settingsSummary() {\n    $summary = array();\n    $image_styles = image_style_options(FALSE);\n    // Unset possible &#39;No defined styles&#39;

=&gt; $image_uri,\n        );\n      }\n    }\n    return $elements;\n  }\n</code></pre><p>If you read the logic only determine if the configuration require use any image style or if is only required the original image, in both sceneries the proper path url is return.</p>\n<p>We don’t need any transformation to JSON because that is handled by view Display selected.</p>\n<p>#Module usage</p>\n<p>After enable our custom module we just need edit our view and edit the field to use new Raw Formatter as you can see in the following image.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/image_field_raw_formatter.png\"/></p>\n<p>After save the view and run again the output will be totally different and perfect to use in RESTful services to avoid HTML parsing to extract the image path. check the output example below.</p>\n<pre><code>[\n  {\n    title: &quot;Image sample # 3&quot;,\n    field_image: &quot;http://drupal8b3.dev/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/field/image/globe.jpg?itok=wmu3VCr6&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    title: &quot;Image sample # 2&quot;,\n    field_image: &quot;http://drupal8b3.dev/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/field/image/sample_08.jpg?itok=X9N005N1&quot;\n  },\n  {\n    title: &quot;Image sample # 1&quot;,\n    field_image: &quot;http://drupal8b3.dev/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/field/image/sample_01.jpg?itok=UD1-QXTj&quot;\n  }\n]\n</code></pre><p>You can download a full implementation of this custom Image Raw Field Formatter at <a href=\"https://github.com/enzolutions/image_raw_formatter\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/enzolutions/image_raw_formatter</a>.</p>\n<p>I expect you found this blog entry useful.</p>\n",

= &quot;/bundles/{entity}&quot;\n *   }\n * )\n */\n</code></pre><p>As you can see we provide a Resource <strong>id</strong> with a <strong>label</strong>, also we define the <strong>canonical</strong> URL for our REST Resource with a parameter named <strong>entity</strong></p>\n<p>Using the annotation the Discover for Rest Resources will declare the routing dynamically so we don’t need include a <strong>routing.yml</strong> file in our module.</p>\n<p>##Implement Class</p>\n<p>Now we have to create a class extending from <a href=\"https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21modules%21rest%21src%21Plugin%21ResourceBase.php/class/ResourceBase/8\" target=\"_blank\">ResourceBase</a> as you can see in the following snippet</p>\n<pre><code>class EntityBundlesResource extends ResourceBase {\n  /**\n   *  A curent user instance.\n   *\n   * @var \\Drupal\\Core\\Session\\AccountProxyInterface\n   */\n  protected $currentUser;\n  /**\n   *  A instance of entity manager.\n   *\n   * @var \\Drupal\\Core\\Entity\\EntityManagerInterface\n   */\n  protected $entityManager;\n}\n</code></pre><p>Our implementation require two properties for <strong>Current User</strong> and <strong>EntityManager</strong>.</p>\n<p>#Class Setup</p>\n<p>As you can imagine each class require a constructor and Drupal 8 is not the exception, but Drupal also implement\n<a href=\"http://www.phptherightway.com/pages/Design-Patterns.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Factory Pattern</a> to prepare the values to send to constructor.</p>\n<p>But is better to explain to you with the following example where we need to send the <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/node/2133171\" target=\"_blank\">services</a>: <strong>Resource Format</strong>, <strong>Logger</strong>, <strong>Entity manager</strong> and <strong>Current User</strong> to the <strong>constructor</strong></p>\n<pre><code>/**\n   * {@inheritdoc}\n   */\n  public static function create(ContainerInterface $container, array $configuration, $plugin_id, $plugin_definition) {\n    return new static(\n      $configuration,\n      $plugin_id,\n      $plugin_definition,\n      $container-&gt;getParameter(&#39;serializer.formats&#39;),\n      $container-&gt;get(&#39;logger.factory&#39;)-&gt;get(&#39;rest&#39;),\n      $container-&gt;get(&#39;entity.manager&#39;),\n      $container-&gt;get(&#39;current_user&#39;)\n    );\n  }\n</code></pre><p>Now we need to define the constructor where we are receiving the values from the create method, as you can see below.</p>\n<pre><code>/**\n  * Constructs a Drupal\\rest\\Plugin\\ResourceBase object.\n  *\n  * @param array $configuration\n  *   A configuration array containing information about the plugin instance.\n  * @param string $plugin_id\n  *   The plugin_id for the plugin instance.\n  * @param mixed $plugin_definition\n  *   The plugin implementation definition.\n  * @param array $serializer_formats\n  *   The available serialization formats.\n  * @param \\Psr\\Log\\LoggerInterface $logger\n  *   A logger instance.\n  */\n  public function __construct(\n    array $configuration,\n    $plugin_id,\n    $plugin_definition,\n    array $serializer_formats,\n    LoggerInterface $logger,\n    EntityManagerInterface $entity_manager,\n    AccountProxyInterface $current_user) {\n    parent::__construct($configuration, $plugin_id, $plugin_definition, $serializer_formats, $logger);\n\n    $this-&gt;entityManager = $entity_manager;\n    $this-&gt;currentUser = $current_user;\n  }\n</code></pre><p>#Implement REST method</p>\n<p>Last but not least we have to define the RESTful state we want to implement, in my example I want to implement a GET method to response according the parameters.</p>\n<p>Inside the class with have to create a method matching the RESTful state name, so for GET we have to implement a method named <strong>get</strong> as you can see in the following snippet.</p>\n<pre><code>  /*\n   * Responds to GET requests.\n   *\n   * Returns a list of bundles for specified entity.\n   *\n   * @return \\Drupal\\rest\\ResourceResponse\n   *   The response containing a list of bundle names.\n   *\n   * @throws \\Symfony\\Component\\HttpKernel\\Exception\\HttpException\n   */\n  public function get($entity = NULL) {\n    if ($entity) {\n      $permission = &#39;Administer content types&#39;;\n      if(!$this-&gt;currentUser-&gt;hasPermission($permission)) {\n        throw new AccessDeniedHttpException();\n      }\n      $bundles_entities = \\Drupal::entityManager()-&gt;getStorage($entity .&#39;_type&#39;)-&gt;loadMultiple();\n      $bundles = array();\n      foreach ($bundles_entities as $entity) {\n        $bundles[$entity-&gt;id()] = $entity-&gt;label();\n      }\n      if (!empty($bundles)) {\n        return new ResourceResponse($bundles);\n      }\n      throw new NotFoundHttpException(t(&#39;Bundles for entity @entity were not found&#39;, array(&#39;@entity&#39; =&gt; $entity)));\n    }\n\n    throw new HttpException(t(&#39;Entity wasn\\&#39;t provided&#39;));\n  }\n</code></pre><p>As you can see the method receive as parameter the last value pass to URL.</p>\n<p>Also using the <a href=\"https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21lib%21Drupal%21Core%21Session%21AccountProxyInterface.php/interface/AccountProxyInterface/8\" target=\"_blank\">Account Proxy Interface</a> we can determine if Current User has enough rights to get the bundle list.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21lib%21Drupal%21Core%21Entity%21EntityManagerInterface.php/interface/EntityManagerInterface/8\" target=\"_blank\">Entity Manager Interface</a> allow us to we get the list of bundles for Entity requested.</p>\n<p>After that we prepare an array with the results, these results will be transformed to the proper format requested by the user using the class <a href=\"https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21modules%21rest%21src%21ResourceResponse.php/class/ResourceResponse/8\" target=\"_blank\">ResourceResponse</a>, in our case we will request a json response.</p>\n<p>If you want to implement RESTful state POST just add a method <strong>post</strong></p>\n<p>You can see a full and functional custom REST Resources at <a href=\"https://github.com/enzolutions/entity_rest_extra\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/enzolutions/entity_rest_extra</a></p>\n<p>#Using our new Resource</p>\n<p>Using the contrib module <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/restui/git-instructions\" target=\"_blank\">Rest UI</a> (I recommend to use the git version until Drupal 8 get a first release) you can enable your custom Rest Resource.</p>\n<p>This module enable a UI to set the Authentication and format for each RESTful method implemented as you can see in the following image.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/restui_bundle_entities_settings.png\"/></p>\n<p>Using this setting the access to Resource will be granted or denied.</p>\n<p>Using the Chrome Application <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm\">Postman - REST Client</a> you can execute an authenticated request to URL <strong><a href=\"http://example.com/bundles/node\">http://example.com/bundles/node</a></strong> as you can see in the following image.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/postman_rest_request.png\"/></p>\n<p>If all is working as expected you will get a similar result to next json output.</p>\n<pre><code>{\n  &quot;article&quot;: &quot;Article&quot;,\n  &quot;page&quot;: &quot;Basic page&quot;\n}\n</code></pre><p>I hope you find this blog entry usefull.</p>\n",

      "body": "<p>Usually Cron could be used to execute tasks who require a lot of processing, is normal to execute this tasks over a list of items.</p>\n<p>The problem with this requirements is maybe there is not enough with one cron time execution to process the whole elements in our list of items to process. So we have to save the status of our execution to continue the next time the cron is executed.</p>\n<p>We can do that with <a href=\"https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21modules%21system%21core.api.php/group/queue/8\" target=\"_blank\">Queue Operations</a>, but this solution is complex to implement(maybe just for me) so I will propose a simple option to implement the resume feature.</p>\n<p>#Working with our list of items to process.</p>\n<p>Lets imagine we store our list of items in and array, and the normal option to process and array is using a <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/control-structures.foreach.php\" target=\"_blank\">foreach</a>.</p>\n<p>Well we can’t use a foreach in our resume because this function starts his execution with a reset of the internal array pointer to the first element of the array and that is not good for our resume process.</p>\n<p>So I have to use a different solution to do that, let me show you my first implementation</p>\n<pre><code>foreach ( $array as $array_key =&gt; $array_value ) {\n}\n</code></pre><p>Instead of that I decide to use a simple while with some changes to simulate the array key assignation in a variable as you can see in the following snippet.</p>\n<pre><code>while (list($array_key, $array_value) = each($array)) {\n}\n</code></pre><p>#Store last state</p>\n<p>With the problem about array pointer resolved we need store the last correct pointer processed by cron, to store that I use a new feature of Drupal 8 <a href=\"https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core!lib!Drupal.php/function/Drupal%3A%3Astate/8\" target=\"_blank\">Drupal::state()</a>.</p>\n<p>Drupal:state store temporary and not critical information, this information is not be migrated between environments in a eventual migration to production.</p>\n<p>Let me show you how to use in combination with while loops</p>\n<pre><code>while (list($array_key, $array_value) = each($array)) {\n\n  // --- INSERT LONG OPERATIONS HERE --\n\n  // Set last bank process to continue after this bank\n  \\Drupal::state()-&gt;set(&#39;last_key&#39;, $array_key);\n}\n\n// Delete last bank if all were processed\n\\Drupal::state()-&gt;delete(&#39;last_key&#39;);\n</code></pre><p>If the hook_cron is interrupted at least we will know in the last index executed without problems, because is stored in state variable <strong>last_key</strong></p>\n<p>If we don’t get any interruption we must delete the state variable.</p>\n<p>#Set array pointer</p>\n<p>First I need to create a custom function named <strong>_array_set_pointer_by_key</strong> to set the array pointer to any arbitrary position, let me show the implementation.</p>\n<pre><code>function _array_set_pointer_by_key(&amp;$array, $key)\n{\n    reset($array);\n    while($index=key($array))\n    {\n        if($index==$key)\n            break;\n\n        next($array);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre><p>The function above works with any kind of array keys.</p>\n<p>Now we need to validate if we have to resume the execution of <strong>hook_cron</strong> in some position of our array of list of items, using again the <strong>Drupal::State</strong> to get the information as you can see in the following piece of code.</p>\n<pre><code>$last_key = \\Drupal::state()-&gt;get($last_bank_variable, null);\n\nif ($last_key) {\n  // Set pointer to last key to process\n  _array_set_pointer_by_key($array, $last_key);\n\n  // Set array to next valid bank to process\n  next($array);\n}\n</code></pre><p>After reset the array we use the <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/function.next.php\" target=\"_blank\">next</a> function to move the pointer to next position where we want to resume.</p>\n<p>I hope you find this blog entry useful.</p>\n",

{ name: authentication_provider, priority: 100 }\n</code></pre><p>The discover for services will find this file and registering our Authentication Provider Class <strong>Drupal\\ip_consumer_auth\\Authentication\\Provider\\IPConsumerAuth</strong> and prepare the elements to send to constructor.</p>\n<p>With the sentence above we don’t have to implement the method <strong>create</strong> in our class, because the Discover send the parameters using <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection\" target=\"_blank\">Dependency Injection</a>.</p>\n<p>At the end we define the priority, this value will define the execution order if multiple Authentication Provider were enabled.</p>\n<p>##Implement Class Authentication Provider IPConsumerAuth</p>\n<p>Our class <strong>IPConsumerAuth</strong> must implement the interface <a href=\"https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core!lib!Drupal!Core!Authentication!AuthenticationProviderInterface.php/interface/AuthenticationProviderInterface/8\" target=\"_blank\">AuthenticationProviderInterface</a> as you can see in the following snippet.</p>\n<pre><code>/**\n * IP Consumer authentication provider.\n */\nclass IPConsumerAuth implements AuthenticationProviderInterface {\n}\n</code></pre><p>##Libraries\nThe Authentication Provider require some libraries and we must to inform to AutoLoader where are these libraries, let me show the complete list.</p>\n<pre><code>namespace Drupal\\ip_consumer_auth\\Authentication\\Provider;\n\nuse \\Drupal\\Component\\Utility\\String;\nuse Drupal\\Core\\Authentication\\AuthenticationProviderInterface;\nuse Drupal\\Core\\Config\\ConfigFactoryInterface;\nuse Drupal\\Core\\Entity\\EntityManagerInterface;\nuse Drupal\\Core\\Flood\\FloodInterface;\nuse Drupal\\user\\UserAuthInterface;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\HttpFoundation\\Request;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\HttpKernel\\Event\\GetResponseForExceptionEvent;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\HttpKernel\\Exception\\UnauthorizedHttpException;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\HttpKernel\\Exception\\AccessDeniedHttpException;\n</code></pre><p>##Implement method applies\nEven if the Authentication Provider is enabled for some REST resource is required a validation to confirm the Authentication Provider apply for current Request.</p>\n<p>In our case if our Authentication Provider was enabled we will add any extra validation as you can see in the following implementation.</p>\n<pre><code>/**\n * {@inheritdoc}\n */\npublic function applies(Request $request) {\n  // If Authentication Provider is enabled always apply\n  return TRUE;\n}\n</code></pre><p>##Implement method authenticate\nNow we have to implement the logic to execute to validate the Request, check the following snippet.</p>\n<pre><code>/**\n * {@inheritdoc}\n */\npublic function authenticate(Request $request) {\n  $allowed_ip_consumers = $this-&gt;configFactory-&gt;get(&#39;ip_consumer_auth.consumers_form_config&#39;)-&gt;get(&#39;allowed_ip_consumers&#39;);\n  $ips = array_map(&#39;trim&#39;, explode( &quot;\\n&quot;, $allowed_ip_consumers));\n  $consumer_ip = $request-&gt;getClientIp(TRUE);\n  if (in_array($consumer_ip, $ips)) {\n    // Return Anonymous user\n    return $this-&gt;entityManager-&gt;getStorage(&#39;user&#39;)-&gt;load(0);\n  }\n  else{\n    throw new AccessDeniedHttpException();\n    return null;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre><p>In the implementation above I use the <strong>configFactory</strong> to get the information stored about allowed IP Consumer using the Settings form created before.</p>\n<p>The authenticate method receive an <a href=\"http://api.symfony.com/2.0/Symfony/Component/HttpFoundation/Request.html\" target=\"_blank\">Request</a> object defined in <a href=\"http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/http_foundation/introduction.html\"></a>The HttpFoundation Component</a> of <a href=\"http://symfony.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Symfony</a>.</p>\n<p>Using the Request method <a href=\"http://api.symfony.com/2.0/Symfony/Component/HttpFoundation/Request.html#method_getClientIp\" target=\"_blank\">getClientIp</a> we get the IP of Consumer.</p>\n<p>I used the PHP functions <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/es/function.explode.php\" target=\"_blank\">explode</a>, <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/es/function.array-map.php\" target=\"_blank\">array_map</a> and <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/function.in-array.php\" target=\"_blank\">in_array</a> to determine if IP consumer belong to Allowed IP consumer. I know maybe with a regex will be more efficient but I really sucks in Regex.</p>\n<p>If validation pass I return an Account object for Anonymous user, if fail an Access Denied Exception is throw.</p>\n<p>##Implement method handleException\nIf the IP wasn’t in the allowed list of IP Consumer an exception is throw, using the method <strong>handleException</strong> we have the option to intercept and process to produce any output desired.</p>\n<p>Let me share with you my implementation</p>\n<pre><code>  /**\n   * {@inheritdoc}\n   */\n  public function cleanup(Request $request) {}\n\n  /**\n   * {@inheritdoc}\n   */\n  public function handleException(GetResponseForExceptionEvent $event) {\n    $exception = $event-&gt;getException();\n    if ($exception instanceof AccessDeniedHttpException) {\n      $event-&gt;setException(new UnauthorizedHttpException(&#39;Invalid consumer origin.&#39;, $exception));\n      return TRUE;\n    }\n    return FALSE;\n  }\n</code></pre><p>As you can see is not to complex, but is just an idea above what you can do with this method.</p>\n<p>#Usage</p>\n<p>After create our module with our custom Authentication Provider and enable it, we are ready to start to use.</p>\n<p>Lets imagine you install the module <a href=\"https://github.com/enzolutions/entity_rest_extra\" target=\"_blank\">Entity Rest Extra</a> and we will use our Authentication Provider.</p>\n<p>Using the <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/restui/git-instructions\" target=\"_blank\">Rest UI</a>(I recommend to use the git version until Drupal 8 get a first release) module we enable the REST Resource and enable our Custom Authentication Provider, as you can see in the following image.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/custom_authentication_provider.png\"/></p>\n<p>##Access Denied\nNow if you try to access via CORS the REST end point <strong><a href=\"http://example.com/bundles/node\">http://example.com/bundles/node</a></strong> you will get an error <strong>403 Forbidden</strong> because the allowed IP consumers weren’t defined yet.</p>\n<p>##Unauthorized\nAfter enable your IP consumer and try again <strong><a href=\"http://example.com/bundles/node\">http://example.com/bundles/node</a></strong> you will get an error <strong>401 Unauthorized</strong></p>\n<p>If that error doesn’t have any logic for you let me explain, remember in our Authentication Provider we don’t have information about any user, so if the request pass the validation of IP Consumer we return an Anonymous user.</p>\n<p>When we enable any REST Resource in Drupal 8 a new set of  permissions is created, in our case we have to assign the permission <strong>Access GET on Bundles by entities resource</strong> to Anonymous user as you can see in the following image.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/rest_anonymous_permission.png\"/></p>\n<p>##Access Denied AGAIN\nWell maybe at this point you get MAD with me, because now you get again an error\n <strong>403 Forbidden</strong>, but at this time the fault is not caused by Authentication Provider or by Rest permission itself.</p>\n<p> The error now is related with REST Resource itself is you check the code of module <strong>Entity Rest Extra</strong> you will found the permission <strong>Administer content types</strong> is required to access this Resource.</p>\n<p>##Bonus\n Well you can complain about nobody inform to you that module has own permissions validation or the REST permissions, well that could be true.</p>\n<p> If you want to get more information about a specific Drupal 8 router you can use the <strong>Drupal Console</strong>.</p>\n<p> First thing you have to do is determine the Router id, we can you the canonical URL of REST resource as you can see in the following command.</p>\n <pre>\n $ console router:debug | grep bundles/{entity}\n rest.entity_bundles.GET.json                             /bundles/{entity}\n </pre>\n\n<p> Now we can get more information about router using the following command.</p>\n <pre>\n $ console router:debug rest.entity_bundles.GET.json\n Route name                   Options\n rest.entity_bundles.GET.json\n  + Pattern                   /bundles/{entity}\n  + Defaults\n   - _controller              Drupal\\rest\\RequestHandler::handle\n   - _plugin                  entity_bundles\n  + Options\n   - compiler_class           \\Drupal\\Core\\Routing\\RouteCompiler\n   - _access_mode             ANY\n   - 0                        ip_consumer_auth\n   - 0                        access_check.permission\n  </pre>\n\n<p> As you can see the last thing executed is access_check.permission generating the error 401. Maybe in the future the internal permissions in resourced will be included.</p>\n<p> If you want see a complete implementation of Authentication provider you clone the project <a href=\"https://github.com/enzolutions/ip_consumer_auth\" target=\"_blank\">IP Consumer Auth</a></p>\n<p> I hope you found this blog entry useful.</p>\n",

By default there are two layouts Admin and Default</p>\n<p><img src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/backdrop_layout_ui.png\"/></p>\n<p>You can create your own Layouts and apply this layouts using a match by URL and/or you can add conditions, as you can see in the following image.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/backdrop_new_layout.png\"/></p>\n<p>Backdrop doesn’t have a menu to get the list of block generated via code, this list of block is only available when edit a Layout and add a block as you can see in the following imagen.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/backdrop_layout_add_block.png\"/></p>\n<p>#Module Migration\nWell maybe this is the part every buddy was expecting, OK to test I decide to check the list of most used modules in Drupal from <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/usage\" target=\"_blank\">Usage</a> project.</p>\n<p>I decide to test with <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/token\" target=\"_blank\">Token</a> the #4 most used module in Drupal with 746,542 installations reported until Nov 15, 2014.</p>\n<p>I skip ctools because off Ctools is too complex and views is already in <strong>Backdrop</strong> core :P</p>\n<p>##Enable module in Backdrop\nhe structure of Modules in Backdrop is the same as Drupal 7, but we need to apply couple changes to avoid Backdrop report the module was invalid as you can see in the following image.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/backdrop_module_valid_invalid.png\"/></p>\n<p>The only required change in file token.info is replace core to <strong>backdrop</strong>. Check how token.info must looks the file to be process by Backdrop</p>\n<pre><code>name = Token\ndescription = Provides a user interface for the Token API and some missing core tokens.\ncore = 7.x\nfiles[] = token.test\n\nversion = &quot;7.x-1.5&quot;\nproject = &quot;token&quot;\nbackdrop = 1.x\n</code></pre><p>After that the installation process works like a charm, due the hooks hook_requirements, hook_schema and hook_update_xx are supported.</p>\n<p>##Changes detected</p>\n<p>As you can imagine there are some things must be change, in order to use the new Backdrop functions.</p>\n<p>Caveats I just replace the code reported as PHP Fatal error.</p>\n<p>###Replace function system_get_date_types\nThe function <a href=\"https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/modules!system!system.module/function/system_get_date_types/7\" target=\"_blank\">system_get_date_types</a> does not exist in Backdrop, but after some reviews in source code of core I detect this function was replaced by <a href=\"https://api.backdropcms.org/api/backdrop/core%21modules%21system%21system.module/function/system_get_date_formats/1\" target=\"_blank\">system_get_date_formats</a>.</p>\n<p>Also in Drupal 7 this function return a multidimensional array, and each array entry has a title index, in backdrop this index was replaced by <strong>label</strong></p>\n<p>###Replace cache_get and cache_set\nThese functions were replaced by function <strong>cache</strong>, this function receive a bin name and return a Cache class with methods set and get.</p>\n<p>The default cache class in Backdrop is <a href=\"https://api.backdropcms.org/api/backdrop/core%21includes%21cache.inc/class/BackdropDatabaseCache/1\" target=\"_blank\">BackdropDatabaseCache</a></p>\n<p>Let me show how a get change from Drupal 7</p>\n<pre><code>Drupal 7: cache_get(&#39;field:info&#39;, &#39;cache_token&#39;);\n\nBackdrop: cache(&#39;token&#39;)-&gt;get(&#39;field:info&#39;);\n</code></pre><p>Now how a set change from Drupal 7 to Backdrop</p>\n<pre><code>Drupal 7: cache_set(&#39;field:info&#39;, $info, &#39;cache_token&#39;);\n\nBackdrop: cache(&#39;token&#39;)-&gt;set(&#39;field:info&#39;, $info);\n</code></pre><p>##Testing\nAfter apply this changes in module token I need to test, I decide to create an script and try to execute with Drush, but I got the following error</p>\n<pre><code>Fatal error: Call to undefined function node_load() in /Users/enzo/www/backdrop/token_test.php on line 8\n</code></pre><p>That is because Drush doesn’t know how to load the Backdrop bootstrap, so I decide to create a script with the bootstrap included as you can see in the following snippet.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n\ndefine(&#39;BACKDROP_ROOT&#39;, getcwd());\n\nrequire_once BACKDROP_ROOT . &#39;/core/includes/bootstrap.inc&#39;;\nbackdrop_bootstrap(BACKDROP_BOOTSTRAP_FULL);\n\n$node = node_load(1);\n\n$nid = token_replace(&#39;[node:nid]&#39;, array(&#39;node&#39; =&gt; $node));\n\nprint &#39;Node ID: &#39; . $nid . &quot;\\n&quot;;\n</code></pre><p>The previous script generate the following output.</p>\n<pre><code>Node ID: 1\n</code></pre><p>At least this simple transformation is working, I am not saying the migration process of a module to Backdrop is a piece of cake, but until now looks like is not a titanic project for sure any case is different.</p>\n<p>You can check more details about migrate module to Backdrop in video <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by8mMhIpARA\">Porting a Module to Backdrop - Basics</a>.</p>\n<p>If you want to test my version of Token to Backdrop check the project <a href=\"https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/token\" target=\"_blank\">Backdrop Token</a></p>\n<p>I hope you found this blog entry useful.</p>\n",

But of course you can contribute commands without a dependency of Drupal 8.</p>\n<p>Right now the Drupal Console has 28 commands listed below</p>\n<pre><code>$ drupal list\nDrupal Console version 0.6.5\n\nAvailable commands:\n cr                              Rebuild and clear all site caches.\n drush                           Run drush from console.\n help                            Displays help for a command\n list                            Lists commands\n self-update                     Update the console to latest version.\ncache\n cache:rebuild                   Rebuild and clear all site caches.\nconfig\n config:debug                    Show the current configuration.\ncontainer\n container:debug                 Displays current services for an application.\ngenerate\n generate:command                Generate commands for the console.\n generate:controller             Generate &amp; Register a controller\n generate:entity:config          Generate a new &quot;EntityConfig&quot;\n generate:entity:content         Generate a new &quot;EntityContent&quot;\n generate:form:config            Generate a new &quot;ConfigFormBase&quot;\n generate:module                 Generate a module.\n generate:plugin:block           Generate a plugin block\n generate:plugin:imageeffect     Generate image effect plugin.\n generate:plugin:rest:resource   Generate plugin rest resource\n generate:service                Generate service\nmigrate\n migrate:debug                   Display current migration available for the application\n migrate:execute                 Execute a migration available for application\nmodule\n module:debug                    Display current modules available for application\n module:download                 Install module or modules in the application\n module:install                  Install module or modules in the application\n module:uninstall                Install module or modules in the application\nrouter\n router:debug                    Displays current routes for the application\n router:rebuild                  Rebuild routes for the application\n</code></pre><p>Most of them are oriented to generate code to speed up the process of development for Drupal 8, but in the same way of Symfony Console has commands to interact with Cache, Migrate and Database you can contribute modules for any purpose, so your imagination is the limit.</p>\n<p>In my personal case I’m the contributor of commands related with Drupal 8 Migrate and Modules integration. My inspiration to create these commands wasn’t to replace Drush, my ideas was to really understand how the Migration process works and be aware the module activation process.</p>\n<p>After complete these commands now I can say I understand how Drupal 8 Migrate process works and how a module is installed and uninstalled.</p>\n<p>But the learning process doesn’t end in Drupal 8 components, when I try to create the command <a href=\"https://github.com/enzolutions/DrupalAppConsole/blob/module-command/src/Command/ModuleDownloadCommand.php\" target=\"_blank\">module:download</a> I have to declare libraries <a href=\"https://github.com/alchemy-fr/Zippy\" target=\"_blank\">Zippy</a> and\n<a href=\"https://github.com/ARTACK/DOMQuery\" target=\"_blank\">DOMQuery</a> as dependencies using <a href=\"https://getcomposer.org\" target=\"_blank\">Composer</a>. Why code that libraries myself if I can use code create for non Drupal Developers :P.</p>\n<p>So right now we are looking for testers and coders for new commands to improve the Drupal Console, if you think you can contribute with Drupal Console core you are more than welcome.</p>\n<p>Also we expect in the future contribute to Symfony Console Component some code based in our needs, again why create <a href=\"https://www.acquia.com/blog/building-bridges-linking-islands\">island of code</a>, instead of that push back code to the core and help other Open Source projects.</p>\n",

      "body": "<p>Today I decided to nominate myself as a candidate for a position on <a href=\"https://assoc.drupal.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Drupal Association</a> At <strong>Large Director</strong>.</p>\n<p>You can read more about the election process at <a href=\"https://assoc.drupal.org/blog/holly.ross.drupal/nominations-open-drupal-association-large-director\" target=\"_blank\">Nominations Open for Drupal Association At Large Director</a>.</p>\n<p>#Important dates</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Self Nominations: 1 February,2015 through 20 February, 2015</li>\n<li>Elections process: 9 March, 2015 through 20 March, 2015</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So let me tell you something about my and my motivations to propose my name.</p>\n<p>#About Me</p>\n<p>Colombian by birth, Costa Rican by choice, I have spent the last 13 years living in that narrow piece of land between North and South America. I co-founded and have been running a successful Drupal workshop called AnexusIT. I am 38, married and father of two brilliant kids: Axel and Zoe. I enjoy long walks through the hallways of Drupal Groups and have a knack for putting together community events.</p>\n<p>I got into Drupal 6 in early 2008 after working for many years building websites from scratch using PHP and after many months contributing to a couple of PHP projects with the intention to automate the way websites were built.</p>\n<p>#Experience</p>\n<p>My first Drupal project was a real challenge simply because the deadlines were very tight (surprise surprise) and I had no idea how to start working on that thing. I was even the one who had to lead the way and teach others. Anyway, the process was very frustrating but even that the project was delivered with a delay of a few days I ended up hating the project but loving the CMS platform.</p>\n<p>My first contact with the community was in 2009 at the 1st Drupal Camp Centroamericano in Nicaragua were I did two lectures and learn a lot about the community and how strong the product could be.</p>\n<p>After two years working for other’s companies doing Drupal, I took the decision to start the first Drupal oriented workshop in Costa Rica around 2010. AnexusIT was the first company of it’s kind in Central America. I lead the technological and technical areas of the company. I get to wear many hats but Chief Technology Officer is my official title. My favorite role though, is Drupal developer, where I get to motivate, lead, supervise and encourage my peers while still coding for at least 8 hours every single day.</p>\n<p>After the Drupal Camp Centroamericano in Nicaragua I started to organising Drupal Meetups in Costa Rica and building up the Drupal community in Costa Rica. As result, we organised   the 1st Drupal Camp Costa Rica (and 3rd Drupal Camp Centroamericano) in late 2011. We have been hosting this event in Costa Rica yearly with the latest edition being held on August 2014.</p>\n<p>During all this time I was leading the community in Costa Rica without an official title, because we were lacking a formal structure. To remediate that, in January 2015, we (the community) founded a NGO called “Drupal Costa Rica” where I am the co-founder and first President. We are planning on using the NGO to facilitate the chores of putting together Drupal activities in Costa Rica.</p>\n<p>#Motivation</p>\n<p>In recent years the DA has started looking more world-oriented with the inclusion of members from Europe and Australia, but even that the vision is still through the eyes of people from high develop countries.</p>\n<p>After some conversations with a friend from Vietnam <a href=\"http://de.linkedin.com/in/webtomme/\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Soqyu</a> about experiences of activities aimed at building a Drupal community and tasks oriented to create the First Drupal in Vietnam we detect we face similar problems because we live in non developer countries or emerging markets if you want to use other term.</p>\n<p>So what ideas I will support in Drupal association, well I love initiatives to sponsor speakers to training people in emergent countries specially if they speak the language of emerging country and french and english in many countries in africa. If I get a position in Drupal Association I will support project in that direction.</p>\n<p>So based in my experience of 5 years working with Drupal as Developer, Community Lead and Company Owner in an emergent country I want to bring to DA a different perspective about our challenges and ideas about how to improve the presence of Drupal in Latin America, Africa and Asia.</p>\n<p>#Contact me\nFeel free to ask me any question via facebook, twitter, email or using the comments in this post.</p>\n<p>So as you can imagine I’m asking you to vote for me. But also I invite you to check all candidates and determine who match better with your mindset and your feeling. Also don’t forget to invite your friends to vote.</p>\n",

Co-fundador de AnexusIT.</p>\n<p>Tengo 38 años, casado y padre de dos niños: Axel y Zoe. Disfruto de largos paseos por los pasillos de los Drupal Groups y cierta habilidad para la organizar eventos de la comunidad.</p>\n<p>Conocí Drupal 6 a principios de 2008 después de trabajar durante muchos años construyendo sitios web desde cero usando PHP y después de muchos meses de contribuir a un par de proyectos de PHP con la intención de automatizar la forma en sitios web son construidos.</p>\n<p>#Experiencia\nMi primer proyecto Drupal fue un verdadero reto, simplemente porque los plazos eran muy apretados (sorpresa, sorpresa) y no tenía ni idea de cómo empezar a trabajar en en Drupal. Aun así oo era el encargado de liderar el camino y enseñar a otros. Rl proceso fue muy frustrante, pero sin embargo el proyecto fue entregado con un retraso de solo unos días, acabé odiando el proyecto, y amando a la plataforma de CMS.</p>\n<p>Mi primer contacto con la comunidad fue en 2009 en la primera Drupal Camp Centroamericano en Nicaragua donde hice dos conferencias y donde aprendí mucho sobre la comunidad y qué tan fuerte es el producto podría ser.</p>\n<p>Después de dos años trabajando para empresas haciendo Drupal, tomé la decisión de iniciar la primera totalmente orientada a Drupal Costa Rica alrededor de 2010. AnexusIT fue la primera empresa de su tipo en Centroamérica.</p>\n<p>En AnexusIT Dirijo las áreas tecnológicas y técnicas de la empresa. Llego a usar muchos sombreros, aunque el director de tecnología es mi título oficial. Mi papel favorito es el de desarrollador Drupal, donde trato de motivar, liderar, supervisar y animar a mis compañeros de trabajo al mismo tiempo que programar al menos 8 horas cada día.</p>\n<p>Después de la Drupal Camp Centroamericano en Nicaragua empecé a organizar Drupal Meetups en Costa Rica y en la edificación de la comunidad Drupal en Costa Rica. Como resultado de ello, organizamos el primera Drupal Camp Costa Rica (y tercera Drupal Camp Centroamericano) a finales de 2011. Hemos sido anfitriones de este evento en Costa Rica cada año donde la última edición se celebro en agosto 2014.</p>\n<p>Durante todo este tiempo yo diriji a la comunidad en Costa Rica sin un título oficial, porque nos faltaba una estructura formal. Para remediar esto, en enero de 2015, nosotros (la comunidad) fundamos una ONG llamada “Drupal Costa Rica”, donde yo soy el co-fundador y primer presidente. Planeamos usar la ONG para facilitar las tareas de la coordinación de las actividades de Drupal en Costa Rica.</p>\n<p>#Motivación.</p>\n<p>En los últimos años la Drupal Association ha empezado a orientarse mas al mundo con la inclusión de los miembros de Europa y Australia, pero aunque la visión ahora es más global es aún la visión de personas de países con un alto nivel de desarrollo.</p>\n<p>Después de algunas conversaciones con un amigo de Vietnam <a href=\"http://de.linkedin.com/in/webtomme/\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Soqyu</a> acerca de las experiencias en actividades destinadas a la construcción de una comunidad de Drupal y tareas orientadas a crear el primer Drupal en Vietnam detectamos que a pesar de la distancia nos enfrentamos a problemas similares debido a que vivimos en países no desarrollados o de mercados emergentes si desea utilizar otro término.</p>\n<p>Entonces, ¿qué ideas que apoyaré en asociación Drupal, Bueno me encantan iniciativas para patrocinar conferencistas que permitan la formación de personas en los países emergentes, especialmente si hablan el idioma del país emergente como por ejemplo francés y Inglés en muchos países de África. Si obtengo una posición en la Drupal Association voy a apoyar proyectos en esa indole.</p>\n<p>Así que basado en mi experiencia de 5 años trabajando con Drupal developer, Líder de una Comunidad y propietario de empresa en un país emergente, quiero llevar a la Drupal Association una perspectiva diferente acerca de nuestros retos e ideas sobre cómo mejorar la presencia de Drupal en América Latina, África y Asia.</p>\n<p>#Contácteme\nNo dude en hacerme cualquier pregunta a través de Facebook, Twitter, correo electrónico o utilizando los comentarios en está entrada de blog.</p>\n<p>Como se puede imaginar le estoy pidiendo que voten por mí. Pero también los invito a comprobar todos los candidatos y determinar cual coincide mejor con su forma de pensar y sentir. También no se olvide de invitar a sus amigos a votar.</p>\n",

Today I face that problem in <a href=\"https://pantheon.io\">Pantheon</a>.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I implemented a solution hacking the file index.php to enable CORS. Let me split the change in two stages.</p>\n<p>Firstly we have to guarantee the REST method OPTIONS return the proper value, because Drupal 8 can’t handle that request right now, check the code to implement that</p>\n<pre><code>  if ($_SERVER[&#39;REQUEST_METHOD&#39;] == &#39;OPTIONS&#39;) {\n    $response = new Response(200);\n    $response-&gt;headers-&gt;set(&#39;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&#39;, &#39;*&#39;);\n    $response-&gt;headers-&gt;set(&#39;Access-Control-Allow-Methods&#39;, &#39;POST, GET, OPTIONS, PATCH, DELETE&#39;);\n    $response-&gt;headers-&gt;set(&#39;Access-Control-Allow-Headers&#39;, &#39;Authorization&#39;);\n    $response-&gt;send();\n    exit;\n  }\n</code></pre><p>Secondly, we have to modify normal requests to enable remote requests from any source desired, as you can see in the following snippet of code</p>\n<pre><code>  $response = $kernel\n      -&gt;handle($request)\n      // Handle the response object.\n      -&gt;prepare($request);\n\n  // Enable CORS requests, Change &#39;*&#39; for any specific domain or ip address\n  $response-&gt;headers-&gt;set(&#39;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&#39;, &#39;*&#39;);\n  $response-&gt;headers-&gt;set(&#39;Access-Control-Allow-Methods&#39;, &#39;POST, GET, OPTIONS, PATCH, DELETE&#39;);\n  $response-&gt;headers-&gt;set(&#39;Access-Control-Allow-Headers&#39;, &#39;Authorization&#39;);\n</code></pre><p>You can apply this <a href=\"/assets/attaches/d8-cors-index.patch.txt\">patch</a> against Drupal 8 beta 10.</p>\n<p>I know there are initiatives to enable this feature using contributed modules, but meanwhile we get a definite solution, \nthis is temporary solution flexible enough using Drupal 8 style to start using Drupal as backend in a Decoupled solution.</p>\n<p>I hope you found this post useful. </p>\n",

      "body": "<p>Nowadays the ability to search in website almost compulsory and most of the times is took for granted.</p>\n<p>Using Drupal we have two main options <a href=\"http://lucene.apache.org/solr/\">SOLR</a> and <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/\">Elastic Search</a>. \nToday I will explore how to work SOLR server.</p>\n<p>In Drupal there are two popular modules to connect it with <strong>SOLR</strong> <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/apachesolr\">apachesolr</a> and \n <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/search_api\">search_api</a> and I decided to use <strong>search_api</strong> to interact with SOLR in \nthis article.</p>\n<p>#The problem</p>\n<p>Lets imagine this problem: We have an Event content type with a Date field to determine the start date and end date (optional).</p>\n<p>Using Search API that field could be indexed without mayor problems, but if we try to do a view to list all event in a date range\n is difficult because Views modules doesn’t provide the Between operator for SOLR views, this operator is only available\n for views using <strong>Entity Fields</strong></p>\n<p>#The Solution</p>\n<p>Because all events have minute granularity we can’t use <strong>equal</strong> operator to determine if an event belongs to a specific day, to \nsolve that problem we add extra information to SOLR creating two new fields to store the day event in timestamp in order to be \nable to use the equal operator.</p>\n<p>To create these new fields in our node entities we will use <a href=\"http://drupal.org/project/entity\">Entity API</a> and more specifically \nhook <a href=\"http://www.drupalcontrib.org/api/drupal/contributions!entity!entity.api.php/function/hook_entity_property_info_alter/7\">hook_entity_property_info_alter</a>.</p>\n<p>Let me show you an implementation example.</p>\n<pre><code>/**\n * Implements hook_entity_property_info_alter().\n */\nfunction MYMODULE_entity_property_info_alter(&amp;$info) {\n  $info[&#39;node&#39;][&#39;properties&#39;][&#39;event_start_day&#39;] = array(\n    &#39;type&#39; =&gt; &#39;integer&#39;,\n    &#39;label&#39; =&gt; t(&#39;Event Start Day&#39;),\n    &#39;sanitized&#39; =&gt; TRUE,\n    &#39;getter callback&#39; =&gt; &#39;MYMODULE_search_api_property_event_start_day_getter_callback&#39;,\n  );\n  $info[&#39;node&#39;][&#39;properties&#39;][&#39;event_end_day&#39;] = array(\n    &#39;type&#39; =&gt; &#39;integer&#39;,\n    &#39;label&#39; =&gt; t(&#39;Event End Day&#39;),\n    &#39;sanitized&#39; =&gt; TRUE,\n    &#39;getter callback&#39; =&gt; &#39;MYMODULE_search_search_api_property_event_end_day_getter_callback&#39;,\n  );\n}\n</code></pre><p>As you can see we are modifying entity definition to include two new properties <strong>event_start_day</strong> and <strong>event_end_day</strong>,\nprobably the most information is the <strong>getter callback</strong> which is a function used to calculate the proper values for each \nproperty. </p>\n<p>The functions defined in getter callback is used by Search API in the process of indexing to store the value in SOLR index.</p>\n<p>Let me show an example of implementation of those getter functions.</p>\n<pre><code>/**\n * Getter callback for event start day.\n */\nfunction MYMODULE_search_api_property_event_start_day_getter_callback($item) {\n  return strtotime(substr($item-&gt;field_event_date[LANGUAGE_NONE][0][&#39;value&#39;], 0, 10)); \n}\n\n/**\n * Getter callback for event end day.\n */\nfunction MYMODULE_search_search_api_property_event_end_day_getter_callback($item) {\n  // Set time at midnight of end day of event\n  if($item-&gt;field_event_date[LANGUAGE_NONE][0][&#39;value2&#39;] != &#39;&#39;) {\n    return strtotime(substr($item-&gt;field_event_date[LANGUAGE_NONE][0][&#39;value2&#39;], 0, 10)) + 86399;\n  }\n  else {\n    return strtotime(substr($item-&gt;field_event_date[LANGUAGE_NONE][0][&#39;value&#39;], 0, 10)) + 86399;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre><p>Off course you can implement any logic required here, the variable $item is an object representing a Drupal node.</p>\n<p>After clear your cache the new fields will be able to select to be indexed by SOLR, you can do this accessing the URL \n<strong><a href=\"http://example.com/admin/config/search/search_api/index/YOUR_INDEX/fields\">http://example.com/admin/config/search/search_api/index/YOUR_INDEX/fields</a></strong> as you can see in the following \nimage.</p>\n<p><img style=\"float:left; margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/entity_fields_solr_index_search_api.png\"/></p>\n<p>When the process of re-index run again the new fields will be stored in SOLR and will be able to be selected in a View.</p>\n<p>I hope you found this post useful. </p>\n",

To use a command like <strong>yaml:merge</strong>, just install it,\ndo your job and remove it, if it’s not required anymore.</p>\n<p>Other commands in Drupal Console related with YAML files are:</p>\n<pre><code>yaml:update:value\nyaml:update:key\nyaml:split\nyaml:diff\n</code></pre><p>I hope you found this article useful.</p>\n",

Today\nI want to talk about <a href=\"https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle\">Guzzle</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/alchemy-fr/Zippy\">Zippy</a>, I am going to show you how to use both \nto download and handle remote zip/gz files in your application.</p>\n<p>#Installing with composer.</p>\n<p>Firstly, we need to add the dependency in our <strong>composer.json</strong> file as you can see in the following snippet.</p>\n<pre><code>{\n    &quot;require&quot;: {\n        &quot;guzzlehttp/guzzle&quot;: &quot;~6.1.1&quot;,\n        &quot;alchemy/zippy&quot;: &quot;0.2.*@dev&quot;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre><p>After include these new dependencies you must to run the composer update as you can see in the following bash sentence.</p>\n<pre><code>$ composer update\n</code></pre><p>#Usage</p>\n<p>With those new vendors, you only need to use the, as you can see in the following code.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n\nuse Alchemy\\Zippy\\Zippy;\nuse GuzzleHttp\\Client;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Filesystem\\Filesystem;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Filesystem\\Exception\\IOExceptionInterface;\n</code></pre><p>Now inside any method of your class is possible to request to create a client of Guzzle, in general terms Guzzle is like a \nheadless browser.</p>\n<pre><code>$client =  new Client();\n\n// Destination file to download the release\n$destination = tempnam(sys_get_temp_dir(), &#39;file.&#39;) . &quot;tar.gz&quot;;\n\n// Get and save file\n$client-&gt;get($remote_zip_file_path, [&#39;save_to&#39; =&gt; $destination]);\n\n// Handle Zip file to extract in your system\n$zippy = Zippy::load();\n$archive = $zippy-&gt;open($destination);\n$archive-&gt;extract(&#39;./&#39;);\n\ntry {\n  $fs = new Filesystem();\n  $fs-&gt;rename($remote_zip_file_name, &#39;./&#39; . $new_folder_name);\n} catch (IOExceptionInterface $e) {\n  print &#39;Error renaming folder&#39;;\n}\n</code></pre><p>In the code above we are assuming we have the path to file and name and we want to rename the folder after extract, the code \nalso could be improved include a try catch section for extract process.</p>\n<p>As you can see is complex task like that normally is handle by CURL but as you can see Guzzle is more powerful and his implementation is easier to understand.</p>\n<p>#Drupal usage.</p>\n<p>Because now <a href=\"http://drupal.org\">Drupal</a> 8 include several Symfony components and other useful components, the code above could be rewrite \nusing Drupal 8 wrapper, let me show you the implementation.</p>\n<pre><code>use Drupal\\Core\\Archiver\\ArchiveTar;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Filesystem\\Filesystem;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Filesystem\\Exception\\IOExceptionInterface;\n</code></pre><pre><code>$client =  new Drupal::httpClient();\n\n// Destination file to download the release\n$destination = tempnam(sys_get_temp_dir(), &#39;file.&#39;) . &quot;tar.gz&quot;;\n\n// Get and save file\n$client-&gt;get($remote_zip_file_path, [&#39;save_to&#39; =&gt; $destination]);\n\n// Handle Zip file to extract in your system\n$archiver = new ArchiveTar($destination, &#39;gz&#39;);\n$archiver-&gt;extract(&#39;./&#39;);\nfclose($destination . &#39;.tar.gz&#39;);\n\ntry {\n  $fs = new Filesystem();\n  $fs-&gt;rename($remote_zip_file_name, &#39;./&#39; . $new_folder_name);\n} catch (IOExceptionInterface $e) {\n  print &#39;Error renaming folder&#39;;\n}\n</code></pre><p>As you can see is similar and we don’t have to modify the Drupal 8 composer.json file, to include components because they are\nalready included in Drupal 8 core.</p>\n<p>If you want to check a complete implementation of this logic, you can check the source code of <a href=\"http://drupalconsole.com\">Drupal Console</a> project commands \n<a href=\"https://github.com/hechoendrupal/DrupalConsole/blob/master/src/Command/Module/DownloadCommand.php\">module:download</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/hechoendrupal/DrupalConsole/blob/master/src/Command/Site/NewCommand.php\">site:new</a></p>\n<p>I hope you found this article useful.</p>\n",

      "body": "<p>For a long time everybody related technology with the US and more specifically with Silicon Valley, and is normal to have iconic concepts. Now, how that concept affect the penetration of technology around the world? Well, one of the most common commandment for non English speakers is “<strong>You</strong> must learn english if you want to work in this industry”.</p>\n<p>Personally I partially disagree with that conception, I recognize English is important in IT industry because as a web developer if I could at least read English I got access to the latest news and could be in sync with the trendy topics. But also is true that is possible to work in technology industry without any knowledge of English, if you don’t believe me, think about China, India, Japan or Russia they use IT every day and most of them only speak their mother language.</p>\n<p>It’s probably true that they could receive the latest news in technology a little late, but think about this, humankind is sending astronauts to space using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz\">Soyuz</a> a URSS technology from the 70’s, so I guess we can survive with a little delay.</p>\n<p>Moreover, what I thought is really bad with the concept of only use English as the medium to communicate your products, of course that only applies to products that plans to conquer the world (insert <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Evil\">Dr. Evil</a> laugh here).</p>\n<p>Let’s talk about in terms of <a href=\"http://drupal.org\">Drupal</a> which one of the most important Open Source project around the world. I know you will say, well Drupal right now is translated in some level to <a href=\"https://localize.drupal.org\">110+</a> languages which is again a remarkable achievement, but there is always a but, this is only from end user point of view, what about the documentation necessary for people who pretend to support those multilingual site and without knowledge of English.</p>\n<p>Again you can quote again the  commandment for non English speakers is “<strong>You</strong> must learn english if you want to work in this industry” in the sense that if you are or pretending to be a web developer you are suppose to be able to handle some level of English. The problem is using that logic we are automatically excluding the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_total_number_of_speakers\">85%</a> of population around the world.</p>\n<p>Although, these numbers could be justified in terms that 15% is good enough to attend IT needs of other populations, but remember not all of them are IT guys, that would be so sad.</p>\n<p>So, why is it so important to try to attend the needs of non English speakers in Drupal community for web development? Well if you check the numbers of penetration of Drupal in Africa and Asia and in some level in Latin America are almost nothing nothing compared to the numbers in the US/Canada and Europe.</p>\n<p>If you are wondering why? The answer is easy, if the locals can’t understand the logic behind a product, companies or organisations only have two options A) Hire a really expensive developer overseas B) Find an alternative solution with documentation in their language or at least enough resources in their local market trained to maintain that product.</p>\n<p>Then, who is guilty for this situation? Maybe the top notch developers in the US, Canada or Europe, because they don’t think in that 85% I mention before, <strong>NO</strong> is not their fault, surprise surprise is our fault, correct you don’t misread is our fault, you may not know but I am a Colombian living in Costa Rica, so basically a Latin American by definition and I didn’t speak a word of English until 9 years ago, so if you speak &amp; understand English and you have access to that information and you don’t produce content in your mother language too, then is your fault.</p>\n<p>Basically that top notch developers living in the US/Canada and Europe use the language they know, so is our responsibility to translate or produce IT documentation in our languages Spanish, French, Portuguese, Mandarin, Russian, Hindi etc. By doing this kind of contributions we can introduce a huge and positive impact in our societies because that means that 85% of the population will now have access to the edge of technology and that clever guy that we ignore before will join us to produce a change in our developing societies.</p>\n<p>Before you ask yourself, well what are you doing in this direction. I maintain my blog in Spanish too, you can check at <a href=\"http://7sabores.com/blogs/enzo\">7sabores.com</a> and in any project I’m involved I try to include the multilingual component, for instance let me show you how you can translate the project <a href=\"http://drupalconsole.org\">Drupal Console</a>, project I have been investing all my “free time”, into your mother language.</p>\n<h1 id=\"clone-drupal-console-project\">Clone Drupal Console Project</h1>\n<p>Go to github repository project <a href=\"https://github.com/hechoendrupal/DrupalConsole\">https://github.com/hechoendrupal/DrupalConsole</a> and hit the button <em>fork</em> on the top of page</p>\n<h1 id=\"clone-your-forked-repo\">Clone your forked repo</h1>\n<pre><code>$ git clione git@github.com:YOURUSERHERE/DrupalConsole.git\n</code></pre><h1 id=\"add-your-language-translation\">Add your language translation</h1>\n<p>Imagine you want translate Drupal Console to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi\">Hindi</a> which is spoken by 250 millions human beings. just follow the following instructions</p>\n<pre><code>$ cd DrupalConsoleFolder\n$ cp config/translations/console.en.yml config/translations/console.hi.yml\n</code></pre><p>Now you have a YAML file and you can start to translating string to your mother language.</p>\n<h1 id=\"enable-drupalconsole-in-your-language\">Enable DrupalConsole in your language</h1>\n<pre><code>$ cd DrupalConsoleFolder\n$ ./bin/console init\n</code></pre><p>The command above generate a config file for Drupal Console located in <strong>~/.console/config.yml</strong>, to enable the new Hindi language, event that language is not part of Drupal Console yet, just change the file and must be locks similar to this snippet.</p>\n<pre><code>application:\n  environment: &#39;prod&#39;\n  language: hi\n  editor: vim\n  temp: /tmp\n</code></pre><h1 id=\"contribute-your-new-language\">Contribute your new language</h1>\n<p>You just need to add your language to git and commit to your forked repository github will help you to create a Pull Request, but if you need support for that you can contact us (the maintainers) in our support chat at <a href=\"https://gitter.im/hechoendrupal/DrupalConsole\">https://gitter.im/hechoendrupal/DrupalConsole</a>.</p>\n<h1 id=\"sync-your-changes\">Sync your changes</h1>\n<p>If you are worry because new functionality was added and you are behind, don’t worry we added to Drupal Console a command to sync YAML translation files.</p>\n<pre><code>$ cd DrupalConsoleFolder\n$ ./bin/console yaml:merge console.hi.yml console.en.yml console.hi.yml\n</code></pre><p>The command above will retain your translation and bring additions to your translation file.</p>\n<p>“If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head.

      "body": "<p>Did you recall the last time you tried to resolve an issue in your program using a small piece of PHP in your views using <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/views_customfield\">Views Custom Field</a> in Drupal 6 and  <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/views_php\">Views PHP</a> in Drupal 7? Don’t lie everybody did that at least once.</p>\n<p>Even the fact those are accepted module by the Drupal security team, this solution is really dangerous because execute code using PHP function <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/es/function.eval.php\">eval</a>, execute PHP code loaded from DB it’s really bad in terms of security and stability.</p>\n<p>Moreover, if someone is auditing your code, this one is the first bad practice the auditor will try to find in your code and you will get a nice recommendation that you must create your own view field handler to do that logic, in order to improve the quality of your code. But to be honest, I did that in the past and even I did that several times, I always found this process really hard.</p>\n<p>Nowadays the Drupal community is excited about the release of the first official release of <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/news/drupal-8.0.0-released\">Drupal 8</a>, so I thought it’s time to start with the classical posts about how to do our old practices in this new thing. Today I will share with you how to avoid the usage of Views PHP modules and be able to include PHP in your views but still pass the audit of your code :P.</p>\n<p>In this post, I will use the project <a href=\"http://drupalconsole.com\">Drupal Console</a> to facilitate my job.</p>\n<p>#1. Create a Drupal 8 module.\nTo generate a module you have two options, the first one is using the interactive mode, where the application will ask you all options available in the command. Use the following command to execute the interactive mode, check the following image to see a classical execution.</p>\n<pre><code>$ drupal generate:module\n</code></pre><p><img src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/console_generate_module.png\"/></p>\n<p>The second option executes the command but passing all options inline as you can see below.</p>\n<pre><code>$ drupal generate:module --module=&quot;No Views PHP&quot; --machine-name=no_views_php --module-path=/modules/custom --description=&quot;Custom views field to include PHP logic in views.&quot; --core=8.x --package=Other\n</code></pre><p>#2. Generate a custom views field\nViews are now in core of Drupal 8, and everything change. As I said before “Drupal 8 is just a new project with same name and logic”. So if you knew something about views, well that is not too much useful in terms of code, but the logic, in general remains.</p>\n<p>In Drupal 8 views, everything is handled via Plugins and fields are not the exception, if you need to create a custom field you must generate a custom views plugin field. Fortunately, I did a generator in <strong>Drupal Console</strong> for this task, check the following command to generate a views plugin field.</p>\n<pre><code>$ drupal generate:plugin:views:field --module=no_views_php --class=PHPViewsField --title=&quot;PHP Field&quot; --description=&quot;Enable to include and run PHP code in your modules as part of a view&quot;\n</code></pre><p>The command above will generate the following files:</p>\n<pre><code>Site path: /Users/enzo/www/drupal8-rc1\n1 - modules/custom/no_views_php/no_views_php.views.inc\n2 - modules/custom/no_views_php/src/Plugin//views/field/PHPViewsField.php\n</code></pre><p>#3. Install your module.\nNow we need to install our generated module with the following command.</p>\n<pre><code>$ drupal module:install no_views_php\n</code></pre><p>Now if you edit the Frontpage view at <strong><a href=\"http://example.com/admin/structure/views/view/frontpage\">http://example.com/admin/structure/views/view/frontpage</a></strong> you can use the custom field generated after change the mode from show <em>content</em> to show <em>fields</em> as you can see in the following image.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/views_custom_plugin.png\"/></p>\n<p>Pro tip: If you don’t see your generated field, try executing <strong>$ drupal cache:rebuild all</strong> again :P</p>\n<p>After applying the minimum configuration to the field, you will get a view preview similar to this image:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/view_frontpage_preview.png\"/></p>\n<p>The view plugin field generated, by default, return a random string just to show that it’s working. Now you have to do your magic in your custom module.</p>\n<p>#4. Implementing your logic\nIn order to implement your custom logic you have to edit the generated file <strong>modules/custom/no_views_php/src/Plugin//views/field/PHPViewsField.php</strong> and more specific inside the method <strong>render</strong>, this method receives an object of <a href=\"https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core!modules!views!src!ResultRow.php/class/ResultRow/8\">Drupal\\views\\ResultRow</a> as a parameter.</p>\n<p>The default method generated looks like next snippet.</p>\n<pre><code>public function render(ResultRow $values) {\n  // Return a random text, here you can include your custom logic.\n    // Include any namespace required to call the method required to generte the\n    // output desired\n    $random = new Random();\n    return $random-&gt;name();\n}\n</code></pre><p>Now I will change the logic to use the title field in row to print it reversed, as you can check in the following code.</p>\n<pre><code>public function render(ResultRow $values) {\n    // Return a random text, here you can include your custom logic.\n    // Include any namespace required to call the method required to generte the\n    // output desired\n    $title = strip_tags($this-&gt;view-&gt;field[&#39;title&#39;]-&gt;original_value);\n    return strrev($title);\n}\n</code></pre><p>As a result now our field will look different, check the following image.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/view_frontpage_preview2.png\"/></p>\n<p>As you can see this another silly implementation of a custom PHP, but now you can include in this class any service required to do your magic and transform each row in a view using other row fields as input.</p>\n<p>Even better you can include in your code a handler to throw an exception if is required, so your code could as complex and professional as you want.</p>\n<p>If you are wondering why don’t contribute this as a replacement of Views PHP in Drupal 8, well I thought due we have a Drupal Console generator for that, it’s not necessary. Inside Drupal Console project is the eternal discussion about what things must be a generator and what others must be contributed modules.</p>\n<p>Some of them became in both a generator and Drupal 8 modules, check out the following list</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/entity_rest_extra\">Entity Rest Extra</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/ip_consumer_auth\">IP Consumer Auth</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/image_raw_formatter\">Image Raw Formatter</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I hope you found this blog post useful.</p>\n",

I said ANY because this module itself doesn’t have any logic related to Drupal stuff.</p>\n<p>The idea is if you plan to migrate from a specific source like Drupal, Wordpress, CQ5 etc you must write an integration to handle the transformation of content into Drupal 8 structure.</p>\n<p>Fortunately for us at least we have a Drupal 8 core module related to Drupal named <strong>Migrate Drupal</strong>, this module contains some Migrate plugin to run the migration process between older Drupal versions to Drupal 8, but this module doesn’t contain migration definitions since Drupal 8 beta 13</p>\n<p>Therefore, the first step you need to do is install these modules, I will use the project <a href=\"http://drupalconsole.com\">Drupal Console</a> for this tasks and I will continue using some commands available related with migration.</p>\n<pre><code>$ drupal module:install migrate migrate_drupal\n</code></pre><h1 id=\"where-i-can-find-migrations\">Where I can find migrations</h1>\n<p>After install modules Migration and Migrate Drupal, I guess you are waiting for something in UI to start to handle your migrations. Sadly there is nothing inside Drupal Core to provide a UI for migration, this responsibility relies on two contributed modules <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/migrate_plus\">Migrate Plus</a> and <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/migrate_upgrade\">Migrate Upgrade</a>.</p>\n<p>Each module apply a different point of view about migrations, both IMHO looks like <em>Migrate Upgrade</em> it’s in a more mature state. But, there is always a but, I don’t like the idea that you are only available to see all migrations available when you are running the migration itself.</p>\n<p>With Drupal just released it’s probably that you will be in a stage where you don’t really know what are you doing, so I decided to implement some migration command inside <strong>Drupal Console</strong> project with my own point of view.</p>\n<h1 id=\"loading-migrations\">Loading migrations</h1>\n<p>As I said before I prefer load migrations but without running a migration yet. For that purpose, I did a command <strong>migrate:setup</strong> as you can see in following CLI execution sample.</p>\n<pre><code>$ drupal migrate:setup --db-type=mysql --db-host=127.0.0.1 --db-name=plato_tipico --db-user=root --db-pass=root --db-port=3306 --no-interaction\n</code></pre><p>In the sample above I pass all parameters using inline mode, but if you omit an option, the command will start the interactive mode. Remember to remove the option <em>–no-interaction*</em> to enable the interactive mode.</p>\n<p>The command above will inspect your legacy DB and import all migrations available in Drupal 8 to be used with your legacy DB.</p>\n<p>All migration entities created will remain in your system, even after complete a migration process.</p>\n<h1 id=\"get-list-of-migrations\">Get list of migrations</h1>\n<p>In order to get a list of migrations available in your system, you must execute the following command</p>\n<pre><code>$ drupal migrate:debug\n</code></pre><p> As you can appreciate in the following image some migrations work in more that one Drupal legacy version</p>\n<p><img src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/console_migrate_debug.png\"/> </p>\n<h1 id=\"execute-a-migration\">Execute a migration</h1>\n<p>After reviewing your system in term of migrations available, we could execute all migrations available for your legacy system you can execute the following command to start a full migration process.</p>\n<pre><code>$ drupal migrate:execute all --db-type=mysql --db-host=127.0.0.1 --db-name=plato_tipico --db-user=root --db-pass=root --db-port=3306 --no-interaction\n</code></pre><p>Below you can see how looks the migration process.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/console_migrate_execute.png\"/>  </p>\n<p>The image above shows how the command report what migrations fail and what migration works. As you can see each migration is independent and the migration process is not interrupted if some of them fail.</p>\n<p>But if you want to avoid to execute one of more migration to avoid any exception you can use the parameter <strong>–exclude</strong> providing the migration id(s) do you want to exclude, you can get those ids from <em>migrate:debug</em> command.</p>\n<p>Moreover, if you only want to execute one or a couple of migrations, just change the parameter <strong>all</strong> for any migration id(s) do you want, this is useful to execute a partial migration after resolve any issues found after executing a full migration process</p>\n<h1 id=\"where-are-located-migrations-\">Where are located migrations.</h1>\n<p>Now you are wondering <strong>“Where are located migration”</strong> if they aren’t in Migrate or Migrate Drupal. Well, migrations are allocated in each specific module, for instance if you review in your Drupal Core modules in path <strong>/core/modules/book/migration_templates</strong> you will find some YAML files with the information necessary to create a Migration entity in your system. When you executed the command <strong>migrate:setup</strong> all migration_templates folder were parsed to create Migration Entities.</p>\n<p>#Caveats\nRight now there are mostly migrations available for Drupal 6, I guess the bet is related Drupal 6 are more critical to be migrated to Drupal 8.</p>\n<p>You can find more Drupal 7 migration proposed as issues in <a href=\"http://groups.drupal.org/imp\">http://groups.drupal.org/imp</a> sandbox, in <a href=\"http://anexusit.com\">Anexus</a> we propose around 70 migration entities for Drupal 7 and 10 of them were already accepted in Drupal 8 core. I promise to provide a list of all our Drupal 7 Migration in few weeks.</p>\n<p>I hope you found this article useful.</p>\n",

      "body": "<p>This is my first post after Drupal 8 got his first official release, now it’s time to start to do some basic stuff using the Drupal 8 way.</p>\n<p>Even I have been working a lot with Drupal 8 core, there are some typical things that I found still a little bit strange. But being honest if more my fault that Drupal 8 fault; All we have just to adjust own mental mindsets.</p>\n<p>Today I want to show you how to deal with Block in Drupal 8 because yesterday I spent several hours trying to understand how to manipulate a block to extend a functionality for <a href=\"http://drupalconsole.com\">Drupal Console</a> project.</p>\n<p>#Get a list of blocks\nThis looks an easy task, but there are some considerations you must take into account.</p>\n<p>First, Do you need a list of all <em>Blocks</em> available or all <em>Blocks</em> enabled?</p>\n<p>Why this separation is important, well as you maybe know or hear in Drupal 8 blocks are plugins and use <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/node/1882526\">annotations</a> to expose to Drupal 8 their existence. Therefore, we could get a list of blocks but they will not be <a href=\"https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core!modules!block!src!Entity!Block.php/8\">Entity:Block</a> objects, we could get just their definition, this is important because you can’t manipulate them, so you just can use as extra information in your logic.</p>\n<p>Only blocks that are enabled and assigned to a theme and in a region are Entity:Block instances.</p>\n<p>##Get available blocks</p>\n<p>Using the service <strong><a href=\"https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core!core.services.yml/service/plugin.manager.block/8\">plugin.manager.block</a></strong> we will get all blocks available definition.</p>\n<pre><code>$blockManager = \\Drupal::service(&#39;plugin.manager.block&#39;);\n$contextRepository = \\Drupal::service(&#39;context.repository&#39;);\n\n// Get blocks definition\n$definitions = $blockManager-&gt;getDefinitionsForContexts($contextRepository-&gt;getAvailableContexts());\n\nprint_r($definitions[&#39;help_block&#39;]);\n</code></pre><p>Executing the code above we will an output for <em>help_block</em> similar to the following snippet.</p>\n<pre><code>Array\n(\n    [admin_label] =&gt; Drupal\\Core\\StringTranslation\\TranslatableMarkup Object\n        (\n            [string:protected] =&gt; Help\n            [translatedMarkup:protected] =&gt;\n            [options:protected] =&gt; Array\n                (\n                )\n\n            [stringTranslation:protected] =&gt;\n            [arguments:protected] =&gt; Array\n                (\n                )\n\n        )\n\n    [category] =&gt; Help\n    [derivative] =&gt;\n    [id] =&gt; help_block\n    [class] =&gt; Drupal\\help\\Plugin\\Block\\HelpBlock\n    [provider] =&gt; help\n)\n</code></pre><p>As you can see is valuable information about the block but it’s not a real Entity:Block instances.</p>\n<p>##Get a list of all Entity:Block available</p>\n<p>Using <a href=\"https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core!lib!Drupal.php/function/Drupal%3A%3AentityQuery/8\">Drupal:entityQuery</a> class, we can build a kind of SQL query for a specific entity in this case for Block entities. The following piece of code gets the full list of blocks available.</p>\n<pre><code>$ids = \\Drupal::entityQuery(&#39;block&#39;)-&gt;execute();\n</code></pre><p>Off course we can filter the results, for instance, we could use the condition plugin to fetch all block related with help module, as you can see in the following snippet of code.</p>\n<pre><code>$ids = \\Drupal::entityQuery(&#39;block&#39;)\n    -&gt;condition(&#39;plugin&#39;, &#39;help_block&#39;)\n    -&gt;execute();\n\nprint_r($ids);\n</code></pre><p>After executing the code above we could get an output similar this:</p>\n<pre><code>Array\n(\n    [bartik_help] =&gt; bartik_help\n    [himalaya_help] =&gt; himalaya_help\n    [seven_help] =&gt; seven_help\n)\n</code></pre><p>I got three Entity:Block ids, related to the three themes I have enabled in my system Bartik, Seven and <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/himalaya\">Himalaya</a>.</p>\n<p>#Loading an Entity:Block</p>\n<p>Until now we get definition of blocks and Entity:Block ids, but not a real Entity:Block, let me show you how do that using the Drupal 8 class use <a href=\"https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21modules%21block%21src%21Entity%21Block.php/class/Block/8\">Drupal\\block\\Entity\\Block</a> as you can see below.</p>\n<pre><code>use Drupal\\block\\Entity\\Block;\n$block = Block::load(&#39;bartik_help&#39;);\nprint_r($block);\n</code></pre><p>The code above load the Entity:Block for <strong>bartik_help</strong>, if you execute this code in your custom module you will get an output like this.</p>\n<pre><code>Drupal\\block\\Entity\\Block Object\n(\n    [id:protected] =&gt; bartik_help\n    [settings:protected] =&gt; Array\n        (\n            [id] =&gt; help_block\n            [label] =&gt; Help\n            [provider] =&gt; help\n            [label_display] =&gt; 0\n        )\n\n    [region:protected] =&gt; content\n    [weight:protected] =&gt; -30\n    [plugin:protected] =&gt; help_block\n    [visibility:protected] =&gt; Array\n        (\n        )\n......\n......\n    [dependencies:protected] =&gt; Array\n        (\n            [module] =&gt; Array\n                (\n                    [0] =&gt; help\n                )\n\n            [theme] =&gt; Array\n                (\n                    [0] =&gt; bartik\n                )\n\n        )\n\n    [provider] =&gt;\n)\n</code></pre><p>#Create an Entity:Block</p>\n<p>Last but not least, I will show you how to create an Entity:Block from code definition.</p>\n<p>Imagine did you created a block plugin using <strong>Drupal Console</strong> with id default_block. Using the following command.</p>\n<pre><code>$ drupal generate:plugin:block\n</code></pre><p>If you want to enable that generated block programmatically, you can use the following snippet of code.</p>\n<pre><code>$blockEntityManager = \\Drupal::service(&#39;entity.manager&#39;)-&gt;getStorage(&#39;block&#39;);\n$block = $blockEntityManager-&gt;create(\n  array(\n      &#39;id&#39;=&gt; $plugin_id,\n      &#39;plugin&#39; =&gt; $plugin_id,\n      &#39;theme&#39; =&gt; $theme\n  )\n);\n$block-&gt;setRegion(&#39;content&#39;);\n$block-&gt;save();\n</code></pre><p>Besides, I decided to assign the default_block inside Content region for theme Bartik, after creating the Entity:Block.</p>\n<p>I hope you found this article useful.</p>\n",

The slogan of my campaign was <strong>Let me be your voice</strong> with the idea to try to represent areas in the world outside develop countries.</p>\n<p>Check the video of my proposal. </p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/121906640\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMTQ0ODU1MTUwNA==.html\">Version for China</a>\n\nSadly, I didn't get enough votes to get elected. But, the idea remains in my head; How I could to try to bring the knowledge to those emerging communities in Open Source and specifically in Drupal? How I could encourage people to create their solutions, using their language as a tool to empower their local community?\n\nMoreover, How I could do this without the endorsement of being a Director at Large for Drupal Association? \n\nWell, I got the conclusion that if I want to do a change and don't need to ask permission to anybody, and in the same way here in Costa Rica we started the Drupal Costa Rica community with our passion as our endorsement to build this idea.\n\nFor that reason, I decided to put my money where my mouth is, regarding what I said in my video campaign, including an additional goal: promote the tool I have been co-working for almost 18 months the [Drupal Console](http://drupalconsole.com) project.\n\n**Drupal Console** also includes an important component for local communities empowerment enabling people use the tool in their mother language.\n\nFortunately, I got support from my business partner **Kenny Abarca** at [Anexus](http://anexusit.com) to have a period of four months with a semi-sabbatical schedule to regarding work. Having 4-5 hours per day in duties to support our team regarding of Drupal 8 adoption and implementation. \n\nWhat I will do with the rest of my time, well, we agree that I will be traveling in several developed and developing countries participating in DrupalCamps, Drupal meetups to exchange experiences with local companies and developers. To try to do what I propose last year and promote the Drupal Console project.\n\nAlso, Encouraging local communities to build technical documentation for themselves using their mother language to reduce their digital gap.\n\nWith the idea settle, we create this agenda to visit eighteen cities in thirteen countries and three continents, we want to include Africa, but due budgets restrictions wasn't possible.\n\n\n<iframe src=\"/embed/enzo-tour-2016/index.html\" height=\"360px\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<ol>\n<li>NYC, USA / Feb 10th - Feb 12th &#8594; <a href=\"https://drupalconsole.com/content/drupal-console-introduction-session\">Drupal Console Introduction</a></li>\n<li>Mumbai India / Feb 13th - Feb 20th &#8594; <a href=\"https://events.drupal.org/node/8600\">DrupalCon BOF</a></li>\n<li>Singapore, Singapore / Feb 21st - Feb 26th &#8594; <a href=\"http://groups.drupal.org/node/504398\">Drupal Meetup</a> </li>\n<li>Hanoi, Vietnam / Feb 27th - Mar 6th &#8594; <a href=\"http://drupalcamp.vn\">DrupalCamp</a></li>\n<li>Seoul, South Korea / Mar 7th - Mar 13th &#8594; <a href=\"http://groups.drupal.org/node/507923\">Drupal Meetup</a> </li>\n<li>Tokyo, Japan / Mar 14th <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1680328558921229/\">Drupal Cafe</a></li>\n<li>Osaka, Japan / Mar 18th - Mar 22th &#8594; <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/541411579373436/\">Drupal Cafe</a> </li>\n<li>Shanghai, China / Mar 23th - Mar 31st &#8594; <a href=\"http://drupalcampchina.org/drupal%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E8%90%A5-2016/sessions/drupalconsole\">DrupalCamp</a> </li>\n<li>Beijing, China / Apr 1st - Apr 10th &#8594; <a href=\"http://www.thinkindrupal.com/node/5974\">Drupal Meetup</a></li>\n<li>Chongqing, China / Apr 11th - Apr 16th &#8594; <a href=\"http://2016.drupalchongqing.org/\">DrupalCamp</a></li>\n<li>Chengdu, China / Apr 17st - Apr 19th &#8594; <a href=\"https://groups.drupal.org/node/508536\">Drupal Meetup</a></li>\n<li>Bangkok, Thailand / Apr 20th - Apr 25th &#8594; <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Drupal-Meetup-Bangkok/events/230041865\">Drupal Meetup</a></li>\n<li>Hong Kong, Hong Kong / Apr 25th - Apr 29th &#8594; <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/drupalhk/events/229309147\">Drupal Meetup</a></li>\n<li>Taipei, Taiwan / Apr 30th - May 3th &#8594; <a href=\"https://drupaltaiwan.org/forum/20160419/11612\">Drupal Meetup</a></li>\n<li>Manila, Philippines  / May 4th - May 10th &#8594; <a href=\"http://2016.drupalcampmanila.com/\">DrupalCamp Manila 20016</a></li>\n<li>Jakarta, Indonesia / May 11th - May 14th &#8594; <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/890804504375940/\">Drupal Meetup</a></li>\n<li>Yogyakarta, Indonesia / May 15th - May 17th &#8594; <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1762670827297587/\">Drupal Meetup</a></li>\n<li>Bali, Indonesia / May 18th - May 21st &#8594; <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/244028239283984/\">Drupal Meetup</a></li>\n<li>Melbourne, Australia / May 22nd - May 30th &#8594; <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/drupalmelbourne/events/231089192\">Drupal Meetup</a></li>\n<li>Sydney, Australia / May 31st - June 6th  &#8594; <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/drupalsydney/events/230340301\">Drupal Meetup</a></li>\n<li>Mexicali, Mexico / Jun 9th - June 12th  &#8594; <a href=\"https://drupalconsole.com/events/drupalconsole-sprint-mexicali-mexico\">DrupalConsole Sprint</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>I will take two mini holidays in Tasmania and Hawaii, to complete a trip of 124 days.</p>\n<p>After complete this trip, I expect to help those communities I plan to visit to help to improve their participation in global Drupal Community and for me, well, enhance my vision of the world.</p>\n<p>If you are wondering if I plan to propose my name for next <a href=\"https://assoc.drupal.org/blog/holly.ross.drupal/2016-drupal-association-board-election-details\">election process</a> in Drupal Association.

To get comments I will use <a href=\"https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core!lib!Drupal.php/function/Drupal%3A%3AentityQuery/8\">EntityQuery</a> using this approach, we will avoid writing explicit SQL queries, and our code will portable.</p>\n<pre><code>$cids = \\Drupal::entityQuery(&#39;comment&#39;)\n   -&gt;condition(&#39;entity_id&#39;, $ticketID)\n   -&gt;condition(&#39;entity_type&#39;, &#39;node&#39;)\n   -&gt;sort(&#39;cid&#39;, &#39;DESC&#39;)\n   -&gt;execute();\n\n$comments = [];\n\nforeach($cids as $cid) {\n $comment = Comment::load($cid);\n\n $comments[] = [\n     &#39;cid&#39; =&gt; $cid,\n     &#39;uid&#39; =&gt; $comment-&gt;getOwnerId(),\n     &#39;subject&#39; =&gt; $comment-&gt;get(&#39;subject&#39;)-&gt;value,\n     &#39;body&#39; =&gt; $comment-&gt;get(&#39;field_comment_body&#39;)-&gt;value,\n     &#39;created&#39; =&gt; $comment-&gt;get(&#39;created&#39;)-&gt;value\n ];\n}\n</code></pre><p>Let’s review the code above in detail; As you can see, is required to specify to what kind of entity we are trying to get comments, that tell us that in Drupal 8 is possible to link comments to any entity.</p>\n<p>Additionally, I have specified the Entity ID required to get comments, is possible add more conditions; this is useful taking in count that comments are entities and is possible that comments have customs fields with extra information.</p>\n<p>When we create the EntityQuery, we define what kind of entity we want to process, as the result the query execution will return a list primary keys of entities matching the conditions, in this case, the main key is represented by cid.</p>\n<p>Using the list of comments ids or cids, we load the comment object. I just traverse the option to create an arbitrary array, only to show how do you have to access to comment entity property, usually is required to use the method get, but there are some exceptions like comment owner ID.</p>\n<p>I hope do you found this article useful.</p>\n",

      "body": "<p>One of the most common tasks as a Drupal developer is alter a form created by Drupal core of by a contrib module to \nenable us to include our business logic or  just remove something annoying for our clients.</p>\n<p>In Drupal 8 we still have to the hook <a href=\"https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21lib%21Drupal%21Core%21Form%21form.api.php/function/hook_form_alter/8\">hook_form_alter</a>, I know, I know the whole idea of Drupal 8 is to remove hooks, but we still have some of them around.</p>\n<p>But, this article is not about to discuss that hook must exist or not, Is there and we have to use until is replaced by something else.</p>\n<p>Doing a form alter require a one significant and vital information the <strong>FORM_ID</strong>. Usually, we can get this information implementing a generic form alter and print all form_ids loaded and choose the desired one, or, check in form source code to verify the id in method <strong>getFormId</strong> as you can see in the following method</p>\n<pre><code>  /**\n   * {@inheritdoc}\n   */\n  public function getFormId() {\n    return &#39;search_block_form&#39;;\n  }\n</code></pre><p>That doesn’t look like an old fashion way? indeed, it’s the old fashion way. Drupal 8 allow us to have excellent third party tools, and I want to talk about <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/devel\">Webprofiler</a>, which in combination with the <a href=\"http://drupalcosole.com\">Drupal Console</a> project, provide us a clever way to determine and generate our form alter, fast and efficient.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/lussoluca\">Lussoluca</a> created the webprofiler module, and is an effective implementation of <a href=\"http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/profiler/index.html\">Symfony profiler</a>, using this component to write and extension to provide the Drupal things that Symfony profiler ignore. Webprofiler start as an independent project at <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/webprofiler\">https://www.drupal.org/project/webprofiler</a>, but the last December was merged as a submodule of Devel module; honestly I don’t understand because there is not any technical dependency, IMHO webprofiler must have an independent project.</p>\n<p>#Generate a standard form alter.</p>\n<p>Anyhow, let me show you how to generate a form alter using the <strong>Drupal Console</strong> without <strong>Webprofiler</strong>. </p>\n<p>Using the command <strong>generate:form:alter</strong> we could generate an implementation of hook hoo_form_alter in any desired module, let show you who to execute this command avoiding interactive mode</p>\n<pre><code>$ drupal generate:form:alter  --module=&quot;testing&quot; --inputs=&quot;name:name type:textfield label:Name options: description: maxlength:64 size:64 default_value: weight:0&quot; --no-interaction\n</code></pre><p>As result, we will get the following code:</p>\n<pre><code>use Drupal\\Core\\Form\\FormStateInterface;\n\n/**\n * Implements hook_form_alter() on behalf of testing.module.\n */\nfunction testing_form_alter(&amp;$form, FormStateInterface $form_state, $form_id) {\n    // Change form id here\n    if ($form_id == &#39;form_test_alter_form&#39;) {\n        drupal_set_message(&#39;form_test_form_alter() executed.&#39;);\n\n        $form[&#39;name&#39;] = array(\n          &#39;#type&#39; =&gt; &#39;textfield&#39;,\n          &#39;#title&#39; =&gt; t(&#39;Name&#39;),\n          &#39;#description&#39; =&gt; t(&#39;&#39;),\n          &#39;#maxlength&#39; =&gt; 64,\n          &#39;#size&#39; =&gt; 64,\n          &#39;#weight&#39; =&gt; &#39;0&#39;,\n        );\n\n    }\n}\n</code></pre><p>Checking out, the code above we can see that is just an example, and you need to change the proper form id, but, at least, we have a starting point and example about how to add new form elements.</p>\n<p>#Generate a form alter using webprofiler.</p>\n<h2 id=\"installing-and-enabling-webprofiler-\">Installing and enabling Webprofiler.</h2>\n<p>Firstly, you need to get the latest version of devel module, because as I said before, webprofiler is a submodule of devel. Let’s do that using <strong>Drupal Console</strong>.</p>\n<pre><code>$ drupal module:download devel --latest\n</code></pre><p>Secondly, just enable the webprofiler module as you can see in the following snippet.</p>\n<pre><code>$ drupal module:install webprofiler\n</code></pre><h2 id=\"generating-a-form-alter-using-webprofiler\">Generating a form alter using Webprofiler</h2>\n<p>After enabling the module we just need to navigate to your website visiting the pages with forms we can to alter, when Webprofiler is installed you will get a toolbar at the bottom as you can see in the following image.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/drupal_webprofiler.png\"/></p>\n<p>Now, If we want to include an extra field in theme configuration, we just need to visit page <a href=\"http://example.comv/admin/appearance/settings/bartik\">http://example.comv/admin/appearance/settings/bartik</a> tp store form information in Webprofiler inventory.</p>\n<p>Using the command <strong>generate:form:alter</strong> but now in interactive mode, the command will detect that webprofiler module is installed, and we will provide us a list of form id available and give us the option to remove some fields from form, as you can check out in the following image.</p>\n<pre><code>drupal generate:form:alter --module=testing\n</code></pre><p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/console_generate_webprofiler.png\"/></p>\n<p>The interactive mode provides a list of form ids available; you can use the arrows on your keyboard to navigate through options available.</p>\n<p>The code generated now will be more precise and as you can see using the Webprofiler inventory we could decide to remove some form elements and still include new ones. The code generated will be similar to the following snippet.</p>\n<pre><code>use Drupal\\Core\\Form\\FormStateInterface;\n\n/**\n * Implements hook_form_FORM_ID_alter() on behalf of testing.module.\n * @see \\Drupal\\system\\Form\\ThemeSettingsForm method buildForm at core/modules/system/src/Form/ThemeSettingsForm.php\n */\nfunction testing_form_system_theme_settings_alter(&amp;$form, FormStateInterface $form_state) {\n    drupal_set_message(&#39;testing_form_system_theme_settings_alter() executed.&#39;);\n\n    $form[&#39;color&#39;][&#39;#access&#39;] = FALSE;\n\n}\n</code></pre><p>As you can see the sky is the limit we can create commands to do a lot of magic using Webprofiler inventory.</p>\n<p>I hope do you found this article useful.</p>\n",

El objetivo principal de este viaje es la promoción de Drupal 8, del proyecto <a href=\"http://drupalconsole.com\">Drupal console</a> y estar en contacto con las comunidades para aprender sobre que necesitan para hacer crecer su comunidad y cómo las personas desde el exterior pueden tratar de ayudarles a crecer como comunidad.</p>\n<p>Yo ya empecé el viaje visitando las comunidades en New York, EE.UU., India, Singapur, Vietnam, Corea del Sur y Japón. Todavía me restan siete países y 11 ciudades como parte de la gira. Pero, mi aprendizaje acerca de las comunidades comenzó meses antes de que tomara mi primer vuelo, por supuesto, tenía que hablar y estar en constante comunicación con las comunidades locales, esta parte fue difícil ya que en algunos países las comunidades son muy cerradas y su relación con el resto de las comunidades  Drupal alrededor del mundo es casí nula.</p>\n<p>Lo que pude extraer de esas comunicaciones fueron las siguientes ideas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Ellos están más que felices y complacidos de recibir a los visitantes que quieran aprender de sus comunidades y traer algo para compartir en términos de conocimiento.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Lamentablemente ellos se sienten aislados y abandonados de la Asociación de Drupal; básicamente, están viviendo en islas, usando un CMS que se encontraron casi por accidente.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Entonces, ¿qué ideas o proyectos voy a intentar apoyar dentro de la  Asociación de Drupal?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Librar los multi idiomas en <a href=\"http://drupal.org\">http://drupal.org</a>, debemos hablar tantos idiomas como sea posible. La falta de contenido multilingüe es la primera queja que he encontrado después de hablar con personas de países que no hablan inglés. Se puede decir que esto es costoso, pero las comunidades están dispuestos a proporcionar ayuda a hacerlo posible.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Establecer una herramienta que permita a las personas contactarse y estar en sintonía con las comunidades locales, estoy pensando en algo entre, g.d.o y <a href=\"http://drupical.com\">http://drupical.com</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Incluír un cambio al código de conducta de la comunidad Drupal para evitar que los usuarios traten de forzar a otros usuarios a solo usar Inglés. Actualmente, los usuarios que tratan de decir algo sin usar el Inglés, inmediatamente recibir una notificación no oficial de que sólo se permite el Inglés.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Definir becas que permita a conferencistas capacitar personas en países en via de desarrollo, especialmente si hablan el idioma nativo.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Si consigo una posición en la Asociación Drupal, voy a apoyar proyectos en esa dirección. Basado en mi experiencia de 8 años trabajando con Drupal como un desarrollador, Líder de la comunidad y  co-propietario de una empresa Drupal en un país en via de desarrollo; quiero traer a Asociación Drupal una perspectiva diferente sobre nuestros retos e ideas sobre cómo mejorar la presencia de Drupal en América Latina , África y Asia.</p>\n<p>#Experiencia</p>\n<p>Me encontré con Drupal cuando trabaja en un proyecto muy difícil, simplemente porque los plazos eran muy  cortos (sorpresa, sorpresa) y no tenía idea de cómo empezar a trabajar en esa cosa llamada Drupal. Pero una vez que entendí el CMS, tuve la oportunidad de abrir el camino y enseñar a otros.</p>\n<p>El Proceso fue muy frustrante, pero el Proyecto fue Entregado con un ligero retraso; como resultado termine amando la plataforma de CMS.</p>\n<p>Mi primer evento de la comunidad fue en 2009 en la 1ª Drupal Camp Centroamericano en Managua, Nicaragua donde pude contribuir presentando dos conferencias y aprendi mucho sobre la comunidad Drupal y el grado de fiabilidad del producto.</p>\n<p>Después de dos años haciendo Drupal de forma independiente, tomé la decisión de iniciar un negocio con mi amigo <strong>Kenny Abarca</strong>, la nuestra fue la primera empresa Drupal en Costa Rica en el 2010. <a href=\"http://anexusit.com\">Anexus</a> y creo que de Centroamérica. En <em>Anexus*</em> lidero el aspecto técnico de la empresa, pero, tengo que usar muchos sombreros, siendo CTO mi título oficial. Uno de mis papeles favoritos es sin embargo, el de desarrollador Drupal, donde tengo a motivar, liderar, supervisar y animar a mis compañeros al mismo tiempo que programo al menos 8 horas cada día.</p>\n<p>Justo después del Drupal Camp Centroamericano en Nicaragua, empecé a organizar Drupal Meetup en Costa Rica, así como la construcción de la comunidad Drupal desde la base. Como resultado, se celebró la 1ª Drupal Camp en Costa Rica (3ª Drupalcamp Centroamericano) a finales de 2011. Hemos organizado ya 5 DrupalCamp desde la fecha.</p>\n<p>Por último, la comunidad Drupal decidió crear una ONG llamada “Drupal Costa Rica” donde tengo el título Presidente. El uso de la ONG se centrara en facilitar las tareas de organización de las actividades de Drupal en Costa Rica.</p>\n<p>#Acerca de mi\nCo-fundador de la empresa Drupalera <a href=\"http://anexusit.com\">Anexus</a>. Tengo 39 años, casado y padre de dos hijos: Axel y Zoe. Me entretengo dando largos paseos por los pasillos de los Drupal Grupos y tengo la pasión para armar eventos para la comunidad.</p>\n<p>Soy un colombiano de nacimiento y Costarricense por elección; He pasado los últimos 14 años viviendo en esa estrecha franja de tierra entre la América del Norte y del Sur.</p>\n<p>Me metí en Drupal 5 a principios de 2008, después de trabajar durante muchos años la construcción de sitios web desde cero usando PHP y después de contribuir en un par de proyectos de PHP con la intención de automatizar la forma en que se desarrollaron sitios web.</p>\n<p>En resumen, soy un tipo que sabe Drupal desde tres puntos de vista diferentes, desde el punto de desarrollador, líder comunitario y propietario de la empresa de Drupal.</p>\n",

The metro card has a cost of $1 and you put what you want on top.</p>\n<p>There three buses lines operating from the airport and the ride from the airport is free is you have a MetroCard. </p>\n<p>I took the M60 bus to try to reach the Astoria Boulevard metro station, but be careful the driver announces the Astoria Boulevard at the beginning of the boulevard, and if you get off the bus, you will notice that you are not in Astoria Boulevard station. I made that mistake, but don’t worry if you do that, I took the next bus M19 using the MetroCard I bought before and finally reach the subway station to take the line G to reach Brooklyn my destination, that line connect with Manhattan and many other places.</p>\n<p>In Brooklyn, I meet up again with Vanessa and Edwin. They were so kind to share with me their spare room. BTW. Edwin was one of my first clients when I decided to start <a href=\"http://anexusit.com\">Anexus</a> with Kenny my business partner a workshop 100% oriented to Drupal, and he remains as a friend.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/edwin-vanessa-small.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>##Phase2 and Digital Pulp\nMy second day was good, even the -4 Celsius degrees, but I guess I was better to prepare than my last visit in NYC two years ago during NYCamp 2014 because at that time, in theory, was 7 Celsius degrees but for me was crazy freezing.</p>\n<p>I did a quick visit to <a href=\"http://phase2technology.com\">Phase2</a> one of the most well known Drupal Companies in USA and <strong>Anexus</strong> partner.

      "body": "<p>Today I am going to tell you about my experience of traveling to India.</p>\n<p>As part of my trip, I did an stop of two days in New York with the aim to reduce a little bit how hard it travel to America to India and share time with some friends and other drupalers as you can read at my previous <a href=\"src=\"/articles/2016/02/12/new-york-drupal-tour-2016>post</a>.</p>\n<p>My trip started in Newark airport located in New Jersey, USA. It’s a big airport. My first mistake was passed security so soon, inside Terminal B there are not a food court, and the options available were upscale, and the worst was there wasn’t free internet there. So my recommendation is to verify if there is a food court available outside secure zone and maybe free wifi.</p>\n<p>I choose to fly to Mumbai, India using AirIndia in a nonstop flight of 13 hours and 40 minutes, sounds a lot but was the shorter I found. The embarking process was a little mess due the airline doesn’t have passenger divided into zones so was like in the good old times everybody trying to get in first.</p>\n<p>I bought some snacks just in case. But, I have to say they provide us a dinner and two breakfast, the dinner was Indian food and was really good I could say the best food I tried in an airplane.</p>\n<p>The vessel was a Boeing 777 totally packed without turbulences. But, in a long flight is inevitable to feel a little uncomfortable, we landed 30 minutes before</p>\n<p>In border control, my experience was really good. Because I have to require an e-visa to visit India, I have to use the designed section for that and guess what only two persons, meanwhile the queue for nationals and tourist from countries with free entry were enormous.</p>\n<p>Looks like the airport has free wifi, but require you provide a phone number and they send a code to your phone number, so if you don’t enable roaming in your plan, you are screw.</p>\n<p>Passing customs, I have to face the first source of scam around the world, Taxis. I was informed that there are companies inside who provide prepaid services. In my terminal, I found two one with the label prepaid taxi and other without that label.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/prepaid-taxi.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>The company with the label prepaid, inform to me that the price to Powai was 310 rupees almost 5 USD dollars, and they don’t receive any foreign currency.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the other company said the price is base on taxi meter, but after request they said 800 rupees almost 260% more, but they receive USA dollars. So, I decide just change money to take the first company.</p>\n<p>After paying they give you a receive and then you have to find the taxi inside a parking lot area for taxis near to the exit door. I order a non-AC taxi as you can see in the following picture</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/taxis-area.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>When I found the cab, the first problem the driver doesn’t understand a word of English, I show him my receipt, and that say Powai and he said OK moving his head with their traditional way to say yes and no at the same time.</p>\n<p>Leaving the airport looks like all taxi drivers have to stop and go out the car maybe they have to pay a fee when my taxi driver returns he asked me for a phone number to call to ask the address, and then they talk in Hindi and everybody was happy.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/mumbai-tuk-tuk.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>The traffic looks crazy and in any NatGeo program about India, everybody was honking, sounds like the rules have an enormous gray area, but people didn’t stress a lot, so the system just works for them. After 40 minutes I get my place safe &amp; sound.</p>\n<p>To end my day I decided to try a small restaurant near to my Airbnb, recommended by my host caretaker, 50% of waiters were barefoot, but when you are in Rome…</p>\n<p>I order a Coconut soup with coriander, lamb using Dhaba style and lemon rice, total 270 rupees.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/coconut-soup.png\"/>\n<img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/lamb-lemon-rice.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>In general a good experience.</p>\n<h2 id=\"airplane\">Airplane</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (Kilometers)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>NYC &#8594; Mumbai - India</td>\n<td>12.552</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>3.575</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>16.127</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n",

      "body": "<p>Today I want to share my experiences as a tourist in India without internet, so today was a kind of purge or abstinence day choose one.</p>\n<p>Because it’s is Sunday I suppose the typical tourist sport will have crowded for tourist and locals, so I decided to stay apart of that areas, and I choose to explore the north of Mumbai.</p>\n<p>##Kanheri Caves\nFirstly, I set my route to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanheri_Caves\">Kanheri Caves</a> located at Sanjay Gandhi National Park, to reach that place I request a Uber to pick up me in my Airbnb works like a charm and leave at 8:30 a.m.</p>\n<p>National and tourists have to pay a fee of 44 rupees to get into the park, Caves are on a hill inside the park located about seven kilometers from the main gate, there a service of buses with a fare of 8 rupees each way and there is also a bike rental service.</p>\n<p>I skip the bike rental due do you have to provide an ID and pay a deposit. If you decide to rent a bike take into account that there aren’t stands to secure the bike meanwhile do you visit the caves, the bus service starts at 9:00 a.m. ish, for that reason I take the desition of doing exercise and walk.</p>\n<p>Mumbai wasn’t too hot, so the walk was pleasant in the middle of a dry forest, there were some “houses”, and you can find some ladies selling fruits, seed, and water every 2 kilometers approx.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/ladies-selling.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>In the second half of the road, there were a lot of monkeys, doing some aggressive sounds but nothing else, like everything in life the last mile was the harder position of the walk especially due the hill. Close the caves the well-behaved monkeys change their attitude and in the main entrance one animal almost take my bag with my belongs inside. </p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/monkey.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>About the caves, they a series of chambers sculpted in a solid rock mountain, Kanheri was a Budish monastery start before Jesus Christ era until 11 century.</p>\n<p>To see the majority of caves do you have to hike using sculpt steps, and some of them are a little risky, so I recommend hiking shoes. There are some caves bigger that others and with more or fewer Buddhas inside, some of them are dark and creepy. </p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/bhuda-caves.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>To return I choose the bus option, I was so tired, walking outside the park for some blocks I found a tiny restaurant where I ordered Chicken tandoori masala, the dish was so spicy even that I ordered no spicy.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/chicken-tandoori-malasa.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>##Global Vipassana Pagoda\nWith forces renewed after lunch, I took a Tuk Tuk toward to  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorai\">Gorai</a> Beach, where I bought a round trip ferry ticket for 50 rupees. I have the say India have a lot strong of smells that maybe some people can’t support, especially in you have around a fish market like in Gorai.</p>\n<p>The ferry takes about 20 minutes to rest the destination, apart of Global Pagoda there are two entertainment parks, nobody will ask you for the ticket inside the ferry, but when you walk towards to pagoda there is a guy how to check your ticket and when you return the same.</p>\n<p>The global pagoda was finished at 2009, and it’s a Budish temple, even I am not a religion person I could appreciate how beautiful is and look like is important for a lot of  people.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/global-pagoda.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>You don’t have to pay to see the pagoda, but only in the border of the pagoda, due inside there are always some pupils doing meditation with their guru. Outside there are some free guides providing information about why and who the pagodas was built.</p>\n<p>There is another small pagoda named North Pagoda and you can use to take a meditation class if you have time.</p>\n<p>To return home, I took another Tuk Tuk, due I don’t have an internet connection.</p>\n<p>There two important things to mention, until now I found is weird found people who speak English, and nobody tried to take advantage of my condition of tourist, well play Indians folks.</p>\n<p>##Mingling with local and outsiders </p>\n<p>To end my day I have a nice dinner with J.A.M and Ani Gupta, to talk anything and everything, conversation Pre DrupalCon and Post DrupalCon are an important aspect of be part on a <a href=\"\">DrupalCon</a></p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/chilling.jpg\"/></p>\n<h2 id=\"walking\">Walking</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (steps)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Mumbai (Today)</td>\n<td>21860</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>24.926</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>46.786</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n",

      "body": "<p>After passing my first day in India, I felt comfortable about how to handle this country as a tourist, so the sky is the limit, I said to myself. I was so wrong “The tuk-tuks are the limit”.</p>\n<p>I start my day decided to visit the south of Mumbai; I expected more traffic that the day before because was Sunday. But as soon I tried to request my Uber I notice there aren’t car available in UberX or UberBlack models, so weird right, the situation gets worse when some cars appear available, but the rate was increased until 8.X.</p>\n<p>Trying to understand the situation, I did the supposition maybe people start their days in the office around 9 or 10 am, so I skip the Uber to avoid the rush hour, and I decide to walk towards airtel office to try to get connected to The Internet from my cellphone. </p>\n<p>I bring in theory the requirement to get a sim card from <a href=\"http://www.airtel.in/\">Airtel</a>: passport, a passport copy, a photo and copy of visa. But, the manager of the shop said I need a valid visa for at least 90 days to get sim cards, WTF right. For that reason, I had to call to India 911 in my case I contact <a href=\"https://axelerant.com/team-member/parth-gohil/\">Parth Gohil</a>, and he rescue me request a sim card for him, lucky me he had two photographs in his wallet, BTW, who has two pictures in his wallet nowadays just in case :P.</p>\n<p>Having a sim card, but not connected yet because the activation process takes 24 hours, Parth explain to me that maybe the user rise in prices was related with the Tuk-tuks, or Rickshaws, as they are named in India, were in Strike, as soon he mention I realize the street looks different. So, I decided to Stay couple hours in Parth hotel’s room until the Rickshaws apocalypse past.</p>\n<p>At lunch time, <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/highermath\">Cary Gordon</a> a former Drupal Association board member and <a href=\"https://in.linkedin.com/in/ashwinikumar7\">Ashwini Kumar</a> a developer from Srijian join us and we went to a Punjabi restaurant, food, and talk was so good that we forget to take a picture of us in the restaurant. Shame on us. </p>\n<p>After lunch Rickshaws, ther appocalypse still happen, but Uber prices reach a moderate 1.6 price factor. So Cory and I went to visit Bandra Fort and Carter Road at Bandra West.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/mumbai-bridge.jpg\"/>\n<img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/enzo-bridge.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>I have to say that my conversation with Cory was exquisite because the told me about his experience as a board member of Drupal Association member.</p>\n<p>To end the day, I had a dinner with <a href=\"http://dasjo.at/\">Josef Dabernig</a>.</p>\n<p>it’s good to have time to talk with members of the Drupal community.

But this the biggest time difference I have traveled before in my life, so I expect in a week, or so my circadian rhythm gets use to the change.</p>\n<p>As a result, today I get up a little late, so I decided to visit temples, the first one was the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhivinayak_Temple,_Mumbai\">Siddhivinayak Temple</a>, the template was so crowded with queue about 200 meters, but at least, the line moves faster, so the wait was about 10 minutes. After passing the “security control”, I have to remove my shoes, and everybody was offering flowers to their god, and I saw there is something related to coconut waterm that I can’t understand. Sadly pictures weren’t allowed.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/shree_temple.png\"/></p>\n<p>In general, a quick visit, and excellent if you want to try to live the experience of an Indian temple.</p>\n<p>After finish this temple I walk around two hours with a real destination, I just want to explore to see how looks the real Mumbai and to find a place to take a lunch. I have to say Mumbai is indeed a city of contrast. On one hand you can see a lot of small informal business and people almost living in streets and on the other side of the same street, a vast complex of building for offices of people working for multinationals companies or hotel lie Four Season in the middle of that neighborhoods.</p>\n<p>Almost in front of Four Seasons hotel, there is a tiny restaurant where I order Fish and a tomato soup. Because, in my mind I have the idea how a Tomato soup could be spicy, and I didn’t say “no spice please”, and guest what the did it the spiciest tomato soup I tried in my life and I could handle. </p>\n<p>Anyhow, I continue my route to visit the <a href=\"http://www.hajialidargah.in\">Haji Ali Dargah</a>, and I have to say that doesn’t look like pictures, the place is running down. </p>\n<p>Returning home, I got notified by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/anigupta\">Ani</a> that there is a pre-party meet up at <a href=\"https://www.zomato.com/mumbai/rude-lounge-hill-road-bandra-west\">Rude Lounge</a> were we met with <a href=\"(http://dasjo.at\">Dasjo</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_klausi_\">klausinho</a>, <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/rachit_gupta\">Rachit gupta</a> and others Drupal that I don’t have contact, shame on me. Good food, good place and nice talk the perfect combination to close a day.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/rude_lounge.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>In few hours my wife <a href=\"http://yersika.com\">Yersila</a> is about the take a flight to the USA and after few days we will reunite in Singapore, have a good fly honey.</p>\n<h2 id=\"walking\">Walking</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (steps)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Mumbai (Today)</td>\n<td>5245</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>60.134</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>65.379</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n",

But, before I have to pick up <a href=\"http://ranqiangjun.com/\">Qiangjun Ran</a>, Qiangjun is the maintainer of <a href=\"https://drupalconsole.com/docs/chinese\">Drupal Console</a> Chinese translation.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/meet-jungle.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>Qiangjun is also organizing a Drupal Meetup in his city Chongqing as part of my <a href=\"/articles/2016/01/19/around-the-drupal-world-in-120-days/\">Drupal Tour</a>. I have to say hi gave me one the greatest presents you can receive as a <strong>knowmad</strong> traveler a sim card to get connected to China as soon I arrive in China, thanks again buddy.</p>\n<p>After taking a breakfast, we took an Uber towards “‘Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Museum”m due is a long ride, about 80 minutes, he explain to me some Chinese words and structures. when we reach our destination we foud the museum closed due is close all Wednesdays, lucky us. So, we continue a taxi towards <em>Gateway of India</em>.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_of_India\">Gateway of India</a> is an iconic place and mandatory for tourists, It’s nice and especially when you read a little bit about his history.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/mumbai-art.jpg\"/>\n<br/><br/>\n<img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/gateway-india.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>After taking some pictures, we continue walking in the direction to Marina Drive, the area is pleasent full of shops, where I can found and buy some magnets for my fridge to increase our collection.</p>\n<p>Close to Marine drive, we found an Indian restaurant where we took a lunch, our random selection was Muttom Kheema and Golata + Jeera Rice.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/marina-drive-lunch.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>With our batteries charged we did a long walk through Marina Drive, it’s a beautiful place with an excellent view of Mumbai Skyline. Sunsets and Sunrises must be great to appreciate here.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/marina-drive.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>After having some issues with our internet we decided to take a taxi, but due was hot in Mumbai with about 30 Celsius degrees we want to take a cab with A/C to have a relax return to home, due is a trip of 90 minutes. </p>\n<p>Sadly, there aren’t not too many cabs with A/C, and we finally found a “cab” associated with “Ola Cabs” the Indian version of Uber. We have to bargain the price due at the begging he was to charge us 2.5 times the regular price and the end we agree on about 1.2 times the standard price.</p>\n<p>Back to the hotel, I helped to Qiangjun to get connected with the Slack group for Asian community of Drupal and telegram, some tools I think he can use to continue with contact with their APAC community. By coincidence, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ironkiat\">Kiat Lim</a> from Singapore and who helped me to organize a Drupal meetup in Singapore to talk about <strong>Drupal Console</strong> was in the same hotel, and we hang out with other Singapore Drupalers in an Indian restaurant.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/dinner-singore-folks.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>By 10 pm I was exhausted and ready to do some work, my jet lag is getting better I could sleep 6 hours.

Why, well at the past DrupalCon in India and couple conversations with some members of the community, I realise that will be more valuable regarding the objectives of my <a href=\"(/articles/2016/01/19/around-the-drupal-world-in-120-days\">trip</a> exchange New Zealand by Indonesia.

A place with a nice view and good vibe, we drunk a jug of beer, and then the menu, a combination of English and Chinese.

All via a mentor and self-training. his is a living proof of with determination you can do an 180 degrees change in your life, all you need is passion and termination.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, this camp was a good first DrupalCamp for their community, of course, there a lot of space to increase the Drupal penetration in Vietnam, but the realization of this kind of events is a huge jump towards that objective.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (steps)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Hanoi (today)</td>\n<td>9.056</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>240.807</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>249.863</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n",

Even though was drizzling the view was gorgeous, so I get off the golf car and start walking on my own.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/expo-park-1.jpg\"/>\n<br/><br/>\n<img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/expo-park-2.jpg\"/>\n<br/><br/>\n<img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/expo-park-3.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>I don’t think, so my mobile camera was enough to capture the beauty of this place, so far, my favorite place in Chongqing city.</p>\n<h2 id=\"walking\">Walking</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (steps)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Chongqing (today)</td>\n<td>15,701</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>804.350</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>820.051</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n",

Because he lives outside China, I told him “Thank you”, but couldn’t see a way he could help me, since I had almost everything already set and I couldn’t meet with him in China; So we just continued connected and we started chatting once every few days.</p>\n<p>A couple of weeks after, <em>Kanshu</em> contacted me again telling me that he had found how he could contribute to my tour.</p>\n<p>He said, “I am not a PHP developer, and I don’t live in China, but I am a graphic and web designer, so I can create the official banner of your trip to improve the communication, marketing, and exposure of your journey.”</p>\n<p>I found his proposal very smart because he figured out a way to contribute with his skills, something that I didn’t figure out. In the end, he did the banner, which was used in many events I participated and the infographic statistics of my tour when I completed it.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/enzotour16-stats-small.png\"/></p>\n<p>During our lunch, we had a conversation about how small are the contributions from China and Asia, I told him that situation not only happens in China and explained to him that the same problems happens in Latin America. We talked about that maybe the reason is due the challenges in our societies, people spend too much time trying to survive; So the chances that people have to contribute and help the rest of the world are reduced.</p>\n<p>I agree with the previous analysis, but I resist to think that we have to accept and continue doing the same things. Let’s go back to  <em>Kanshu</em>, he helps a lot of people, not only me, because he has written the first Drupal 7 book about theming in Chinese <a href=\"http://www.drupaltheme.guide\">http://www.drupaltheme.guide</a></p>\n<p>The way I see it, our communities always have the opportunity to contribute something based in their knowledge and reality, also those contributions doesn’t have to have a global impact, some local initiatives are equally important, like his book in Chinese.</p>\n<p>One common belief in China and Latin America ( I can’t include other countries of Asia because I did confirm with locals) is that due the hard competition to survive, sharing your knowledge with your competitors will enable them to do what you do, and you will lose your advantage. But in my experience that thinking it’s completely the opposite. </p>\n<p>Without contributions I wouldn’t be able to fund <a href=\"http://anexusit.com\">Anexus</a> a Drupal Workshop located in Costa Rica with the goal of selling services in North America and Europe.</p>\n<p>In <em>Anexus</em> contributing is the core of our business from day one until now, because contributing was and is still our way to show to the world that we know about Drupal and that we are good, so hire us!</p>\n<p>Because of this, after contributing for almost three years in the <a href=\"http://drupalconsole.com\">Drupal Console</a> project; I have started a new company named <a href=\"http://weknowinc.com\">weKnow</a>.  weKnow is my second company funded with of <a href=\"http://jmolivas.com/\">Jesus Manuel Olivas</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Kabarca\">Kenny Abarca</a> now based in the USA, using the same logic, demonstrating that <em>we know</em> what we are talking about and that we are good on that applying our previous contributions to show that.</p>\n<p>Don’t take me wrong; I’m not saying I have an evil plan to master the world after any contribution, I wasn’t expecting to create any business at the beginning, it’s just something that naturally emerges in my case. </p>\n<p>I firmly believe that contributing and constantly doing it, will eventually have a positive effect in your professional life. </p>\n<p>For me. <em>contributing</em> means investing in our community, which is good for everybody and in the long term it will be particularly useful to you.</p>\n<p>The art of contributing is to find small things you can do to create an impact and continue doing it means that you have a long-term vision.</p>\n",

That situation forces me to try to get a new passport as soon as possible; After checking to Colombian embassy in Costa Rica, I confirm that renew my passport in Costa Rica wasn’t an option due the return time. For that reason, I have to travel to Colombia to renew my passport there.</p>\n<p>With this un expected trip I tried to use in as many activities I could. In Drupal Side, I participated in a Drupal Meetup organized by <a href=\"http://seed.com.co\">Seed</a>, and particularly by <a href=\"http://www.aldibier.com/\">Aldibier Morales</a>. They rent and space and organize the event to enable me to talk about Drupal Console and Drupal Community in general, I enjoy the <strong>Q &amp; A</strong> session, where I could provide some points of view I have about how to handle local communities.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/IMG_20161014_030733.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>With my new passport on my hands, I start a marathon to visit my mother and father familly located in Bucaramanga, Santader. Was really good because for many years I haven’t visit them.</p>\n<p>So, as many time in my #enzotour16 I overcome the adversities and transform in something positive as much I could it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"airplane\">Airplane</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (Kilometers)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>San Jose, Costa Rica &#8594; Bogota, Colombia  &#8594; San Jose, Costa Rica</td>\n<td>2.576</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>106.561</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>109.137</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"walking\">Walking</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (steps)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Colombia</td>\n<td>39.597</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>1.897.088</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>1.936.685</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"train\">Train</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (Kilometers)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Today</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>528</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>528</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h1 id=\"bus-car\">Bus/Car</h1>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Distance (Kilometers)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Today</td>\n<td>796</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Previously</td>\n<td>2.944</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td>3.740</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n",

Becuase I did more that to millions step and other kilometers by bus and train. I also did some leagues by boat, but I didn’t have records about that distance.</p>\n<p>Check the distances in detail in the following chart.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/enzotour16-distances.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>#Numbers</p>\n<p>A lot of things happens on this trip, most of them good and nothing awful, only time to time I get lost in translation and sometimes actually lost, you know the wrong bus or wrong subway line, and you end on the other side of the city.</p>\n<p>Talking about scary situations, well I got two haircuts one in Hanoi, Vietnam and other in Bangkok, Thailand; I have to recognize could be worst, but I always got something between what I want and between what the hair stylist want. But still with two ears and my honor intact.</p>\n<p>Also, I have the opportunity to read two books of my favorite write of black novel <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henning_Mankell\">Henning Mankell</a></p>\n<p>I wrote a daily blog post to try to document all that I live, but to be honest only until my first round around the world, after that I was so tired, and I cheat, and after that, I wrote an entry by country, sorry about that.</p>\n<p>One frightening moment was when a border officer report to me than I didn’t have space for more stamps and maybe in my next destination I could be deported back to home. </p>\n<p>That moment was discouraging for me because I still have to visit four more countries before the end of my tour in next five weeks. So my solution was to include another country in the tour, Colombia, maybe you don’t know, but I am Colombian. So I visited Colombia, get my passport and participate in a Drupal Meetup in Bogota. Also, I visited my family in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucaramanga\">Bucaramanga</a> quite a trip inside my journey.</p>\n<p>Talking about numbers, I collect thousands of pictures and more valuable dozens of new friend around the world.</p>\n<p>Check the figures in detail in the following chart.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/enzotour16-numbers.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>#Locations</p>\n<p>When I plan my trip, I want to maximize the number of countries regarding Drupal communities I could visit on my route. I could visit Africa or the Middle East; Europe was skipped deliberately because their communities are healthy and one of my goals was to visit emerging communities regarding Drupal.</p>\n<p>Even that I could visit more than 30 cities in 18 countries spread over four continents. </p>\n<p>A lot of friends said all my trip was a huge vacation and maybe it was. But only in 3 cities, this adventure was totally tourist; those places were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tasmania in Australia</li>\n<li>Honolulu in Hawaii </li>\n<li>Bucaramanga in Colombia.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I could say that enjoy all the towns I visited, but I especially love Asian food, I guess that in a previous life I have to be born in some place between Hong Kong and Tokio.</p>\n<p>Check the locations in detail in the following chart.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/enzotour16-locations.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>#Events</p>\n<p>This this was all about Drupal community, and I could participate in 32 events around the world, participating as a speaker in all of them.</p>\n<p>I had the honor of being Keynote in 3 DrupalCamps</p>\n<p>Maybe the most remarkable participation was during my Community Keynote at <a href=\"https://events.drupal.org/dublin2016\">DrupalCon Dublin</a>.</p>\n<p>In all those events I always tried to share what I know about Drupal 8 and Drupal Console projects, trying to promote in all of them the importance of contributing and remark the importance of contributing using their language to try to enforce their community.</p>\n<p>Check the events in detail in the following chart.</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/enzotour16-events.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>#weKnow</p>\n<p><img style=\"margin-right: 20px;\" src=\"/sites/default/files/enzo_post_images/logo-weknow-highres.png\"/></p>\n<p>One of the biggest achievements in this journey was the creation of a new company named weKnow, this new company will be dedicated to Drupal 8+ and Symfony 2+ Training and Consulting.</p>\n<p>The companions on this trip are </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://jmolivas.com\">Jesus Manuel Olivas</a> an old friend and co-maintainer with me inside <a href=\"http://drupalconsole.com\">Drupal Console</a> project.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kabarca\">Kenny Abarca</a> an old friend and co-founder with me of <a href=\"http://anexusit.com\">Anexus</a> company.</p>\n<p>#Thank you\nLast, but not least I want to express a huge <strong>THANK</strong> YOU to my family, why? Well, let me elaborate.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://yersika.com\">Yersika</a>, my wife my companion in all my adventures physically and a great remote supporter.</p>\n<p>Axel &amp; Zoe: My children, who may pay the big price in all my travels, accepting that is father is abroad is the best way that I could Imagine.</p>\n<p>My Mom, who take care her grandsons, filling out all the love we couldn’t provide in person, meanwhile we were out of the home. </p>\n<p>My siblings Katherine and Mario, who provide aunt and uncle supervision to my children and why not spoil them a little bit.</p>\n<p>#Summary</p>\n<p>In general was a great year and now I am looking for my next adventure/challenge for 2017 in my 40’s</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading this very long blog post.</p>\n",
